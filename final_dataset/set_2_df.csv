"california update 3 / 27 / 01 executive summary : ? undercollet remains sticking point for utility creditors ( especially qfs ) , involuntary bankruptcy likely if issue is not addressed in today &#x27; s capuc hearings ? capuc rate increase set at 40 % , pending dwr power purchase details ? davis defends no rate increase position , distances himself from capuc qf / generator undercollect may be an invitation to involuntary bankruptcy as reported last week , qf has sitting and waiting to hear what the capuc has to say , unfortunately it may not be what the qfs want to hear . the utilities &#x27; undercollect , which will not be addressed in today &#x27; s capuc hearings , could very well provide an invitation for qfs and generators to file involuntary bankruptcy against socal and pg &amp; e . recent rate hikes proposed by the capuc specifically dictate that any revenue generated from rate increases cannot be used to pay off utility past debt , leaving the qf with little hope of recovery . qfs were obviously dismayed by the capuc &#x27; s draft order and if the decision is passed as it currently reads , an involuntary bankruptcy filing is still likely . capuc holds rate increase hearings today as reported yesterday , loretta lynch released the details of the capuc &#x27; s draft rate increase order last night . there is expected to be a 3 cent / kwh surcharge on power bills or roughly a 40 % rate increase . a portion of this &quot; surcharge &quot; will be given to the dwr to cover its costs and the order concludes that utilities need revenues on a going - forward basis . therefore , utilities can only use the revenues for power purchases going forward and are expressly forbidden from using this cash to pay down past debt ( ex . qfs ) . however , the utilities are ordered to resume payments to the qfs on a going - forward basis . the net effect of the order is to allow the utilities to operate in case of bankruptcy . one interesting point in the draft is its decision which calls on the utilities to join with the state in pursuing a refund on the amount overcharged for power by the generators . the suggestion is that the utilities take legal action against the generators to recoup funds . only the funds recovered from generators can be used to pay down the utilities &#x27; past debt . if the utilities choose this course of action , it would be a very lengthy process . davis contends with lynch on capuc rate increases . davis has thus far refused to support capuc &#x27; s proposed rate increase stating the capuc decision making board is an independent body and that he continues to believe that a resolution can be found within the current rate structure . sources indicate that he is likely to ask for lynch &#x27; s letter of resignation , however , there is no indication she will comply . senator burton , who supports the capuc &#x27; s plan , reportedly will protect lynch by not allowing her to be impeached ( which is the only other way she could be removed by the governor ) .",0

"&gt; er, i understood you until you reached the above. Maybe its my lack of  &gt; PHP but why would a variable name _need_ to end with [] ? &gt;  &gt; With most languages you parse the submitted form data and should come  &gt; out with either variables or an array / hash, which you then work with  &gt; and name whatever you like.IIRC, if the query string containsvarname=FIRST&amp;varname=SECONDthen PHP will create a variable called &quot;varname&quot; with result SECOND.  However, if the query string containsvarname[]=FIRST&amp;varname[]=SECONDthen PHP will create an array with varname[1]==FIRST and varname[2]==SECONDThere are other ways to get the data from the HTTP request, and I guess  I&#x27;ll do that if it turns out to simplify the script that creates the  form; but as i understand it that&#x27;s the &quot;official&quot; way to get data from  a SELECT MULTIPLE using PHP.Dave _______________________________________________ Webdev mailing list Webdev@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/webdev",0

"Quoting jac1 (jac1@student.cs.ucc.ie):&gt; i recently had to wipe linux from my pc but forgot to restore the original &gt; MBR (NT). Anyone know how i can do this? linux is entirely gone and no boot &gt; floppy. formatting the entire disk doesn&#x27;t do it either.The easy way is just to install whatever Microsoft or whatever OS you have in mind:  It should overwrite the MBR.  Indeed, the problem is usually _preventing_ this from happening, as Microsoft Corporation&#x27;s installers seem to forever be overwriting your MBRs when you least wish it, without asking your permission.--  Cheers,               &quot;We&#x27;re sorry; you have reached an imaginary number.

"Brian O&#x27;Donoghue wrote a code fragment: &gt; For(a=0;a { &gt;  some_thing_goes_here(); &gt; &gt;  if(b=strlen(somestring)-4) &gt; do_something; &gt; &gt; };Unfortunately strlen is a relatively expensive operation. If you are using C++ this is not such a big issue as string.length() can be declared const. So long as you do not modify the string object, the compiler can do the caching for you.I do not think this is possible in C, though?You could write the same code fragment as: ============================ for(a=0,l=strlen(somestring);a&lt;l;a++) {     some_thing_goes_here();     if(b==l-4)         do_something(); } ============================Note my previous point: if some_thing_goes_here() or do_something() are very long functions, then there is no real need to optimise this code.Also, for string manipulation, a much better approach would be: ============================ char c; char* p; for(p=somestring,(c=*p)!=0;p++) {     some_thing_goes_here();     if(*(p+4)==0)         do_something(); } ============================This works because C used \0 terminated strings. It improves performance because you always have a pointer to the character instead of having to do array manipulation. Strictly speaking, the variable c is not required as most compilers are smart enough to store *p in a register.The problem is that this uses pointer arithmetic, which can make the code illegable if not managed carefully. Which is one of the reasons I prefer Java for most programming tasks. :)- Matthew __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?

"syntax , semantics , &amp; cognitive linguistics michel achard representation of cognitive structures syntax and semantics of french sentential complements 1998 . 23 x 15 , 5 cm . xii , 377 pages cloth dm 158 , - / approx . us $ 113 . 00 isbn 3-11 - 015760 - 8 cognitive linguistics research 11 mouton de gruyter * berlin * new york this book investigates french complementation and , more specifically , the distribution of infinitival and finite complements ( indicative and subjunctive ) in the following contexts : causation / perception , modal , sentential complement , and impersonal constructions . consistent with the principles of cognitive linguistics , it argues that the surface form of each construction reflects a specific cognitive organization , and that formal differences reflect conceptual differences . more specifically , it is shown that : ( i ) each complement form carries meaning , to be expressed in terms of the cognitive organization it specifically codes , and ( ii ) the distribution of these forms with the different main verbs is a function of the semantic compatibility between two meaningful expressions . the cognitive grammar position expressed in langacker ( 1987 , 1991 ) states that the use of a particular linguistic form by speakers reflects their choice to express their conceptualization in a particular way . the meaning of a linguistic expression is therefore best described as the partial construal it imposes on the scene it describes . in this book , the meaning of complement constructions is analyzed in terms of the specific way in which they structure the subordinate scene . competing constructions represent alternative construals of the scene . the solution proposed in this book departs from existing analyses in three major ways . first , it accounts at the same time for the form and the distribution of the complements . secondly , it posits no construction-specific devices to handle different structures . thirdly , it provides a global understanding of complementation by treating a whole array of constructions in similar ways . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ mouton de gruyter walter de gruyter , inc . postfach 30 34 21 200 saw mill river road d-10728 berlin hawthorne , ny 10532 germany usa fax : + 49 ( 0 ) 30 26005-351 fax : + 1 914 747-1326 email : mouton @ degruyter . de publications by de gruyter can also be ordered via world wide web : http : / / www . degruyter . com",0

"Why am I so passionate about decentralization? Because I believe some of  todayâ€™s most profound problems with networked applications are caused by  centralization.Generically, a centralized political or economic system permits only one  answer to a question, while decentralization permits many separate  agents to hold different opinions of the same matter. In the specific  context of software, centralized variables can only contain one valid  value at a time. That limits us to only representing information A)  according to the beliefs of a single agency, and B) that changes more  slowly than it takes to propagate. Nevertheless, centralization is the  basis for todayâ€™s most popular architectural style for developing  network applications: client-server interaction using request-response  communication protocols.I believe these are profound limitations, which we are already  encountering in practice. Spam, for example, is in the eye of the  beholder, yet our email protocols and tools do not acknowledge the  separate interests of senders and receivers. Slamming, for another,  unfairly advantages the bidder with the lowest-latency connection to a  centralized auction server. Sharing ad-hoc wireless networks is yet a  third example of decentralized resource allocation. Furthermore, as  abstract as centralization-induced failures might seem today, these  limits will _not_ improve as the cost of computing, storage, and  communication bandwidth continue to plummet. Instead, the speed of light  and human independence constitute _fundamental_ limits to centralized  information representation, and hence centralized software architecture. ",0

" Begeman&#x27;s _Manufacturing Processes_ talks about Quality Control Charts:&gt; The tolerance limits for a part are placed outside of the control &gt; limits and are never inside of them.  Once the control chart has &gt; been established, data is recorded on it and it becomes a record &gt; of the variation of an inspected dimension over a period of time. &gt; The data plotted should fall in random fashion between the control &gt; lines, if all assignable causes for variation are absent.  When the &gt; data fall in this manner, it can be assumed that the part is being &gt; made correctly 99.73% of the time; that is, no more than 3 out of &gt; 1000 will leave the process incorrectly made.Taking a look at the S&amp;P 500, and  using the Ibbotson 2000 figures of 13% expected stock return and 20% standard deviation, and taking the the actual 2.5 year return on the S&amp;P since 31 Dec 1999 to be close to -30%, we find:-.30 ? 2.5*(.13) - 3*sqrt(2.5)*(.20) -30% &gt; -60%so it still plots out between the control lines ...&gt; So long as the points fall between the control lines, no adjustments &gt; or changes in the process are necessary.  If five to seven points fall &gt; on one side of the mean, the process should be checked.  When points &gt; fall outside of the control lines, the cause must be located and &gt; corrected immediately.... but maybe we should&#x27;ve checked the process during the &quot;long&quot; bull.-Davehttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork ",0

"&gt;I managed to get myself an iMac yesterday (just a G3 but a good&#x27;un) and was &gt;wondering if any of the Apple people on here could recommend a good ISP (for &gt;narrow band at the moment) for getting online under OS X. &gt; &gt;Stewmy local ISP works great with my iMac. I don&#x27;t know what you guys  have over there, but OS X ought to let you get online as well as  anything else.Crossing my fingers though....I did a upgrade to Jaguar, and ended up  doing a scrape and install after that.

I believe that the netboot  &gt; project would have a PROM you could download and burn, having the needed  &gt; h/w of course.. ;) But the PROMs are for specific network cards, and all their are really is a bootp/tftp client. Not the whole set of nice bits &amp; pieces you get with an OpenBoot PROM. AMD were talking of supporting it ages back, when the Athlon was looking like it would just be on workstations from day one. They seemed to drop it, and go for the crappy MSDOS compatible BIOS though.Kate --  Irish Linux Users&#x27; Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

Before the &gt; &gt; &gt; release of Razor2, I&#x27;d pointed out that Razor2 backend (specially &gt; &gt; &gt; TeS) will be closed. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for the clarification.

It&#x27;s completely transparent. The ratings and the feedback is there for all to see. Most importantly it relies on the individual to make the decision for themselves rather or not to trust a buyer/seller.Contrast this with TeS which utilizes &quot;sooper secret&quot; methodologies to determine rather or not a submitter is trusted or not and at what point something becomes spam at some level of &quot;confidence.&quot;The unfortunate thing is that in my experience Razor is an incredibly ineffective filter at this point. The spot checking I&#x27;ve done indicates about a 40% hit rate. Submissions I made a week ago still don&#x27;t count as spam, apparently because I&#x27;m not trusted enough, or enough people haven&#x27;t submitted the item, or some unknown combination thereof. Why anyone would continue to waste their time submitting items when they aren&#x27;t being accepted due to a series of calculations which will not be shared is beyond me.Any trust model that cannot survive public scrutiny isn&#x27;t worth trusting IMHO./\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\                                Patrick Greenwell          Asking the wrong questions is the leading cause of wrong answers \/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/ ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same old cell phone?

( the core / non - core business provisions , the transmission asset purchase , etc . all appear to have been deleted . ) both of these provisions that have been left in the bill were seen as positive by members last week when the bill was first debated . it appears amendments have been made to sb 78 xx but the extent of these changes are not yet known . at the beginning of both amended bills , it states , &quot; as proposed to be amended into sb _ xx . &quot; this means that amendments to sb 78 could be incorporated into ab 82 , and vice versa . another possibility is an entirely new bill .",0

"&gt; From: Stephen D.

Maybe you never bought a hot dog from a street vendor.&gt; And why is it that the margin of survival is so thin?  Could it be that &gt; all of these tribal rivalries are part of what&#x27;s holding back wholesale &gt; movement to the modern, first world patterns of constructive thinking?Well, yes.  But it doesn&#x27;t change the idea that the margin of survival probably IS that thin in this region.&gt; I&#x27;m sure that both sides were ready to be the agressor.  I&#x27;m not.  I&#x27;m sure both sides were equally ready to be the aggressor provided they were in a predominant position of power.&gt; Bush&#x27;s reluctance to blast blind obeyance of religion as taught by your &gt; local madrassa or KKK leader, apparently because he is fully involved &gt; with the general effort to expand unfettered religiosity as the solution &gt; to the world&#x27;s ills, is disappointing.  He has spoke against madrassa, &gt; but what I heard sounded lame and carefully crafted to shield religion &gt; in general from scrutiny.1. Which religion and how it is currently being expressed matters. 2. The US is trying to avoid making war on the Muslim religion. 3.

"&gt; All else being equal, the terminal velocity is inversely proportional to the &gt; square root of air density. Air density drops off pretty quickly, and I  &gt; really should be doing something other than digging up the math for that. I &gt; think it involves calculus to integrate the amount of mass as the column of &gt; the atmosphere trails off.Chemistry types have a method for dealing with this question without dragging in the calculus:Suppose an atmosphere to be mainly affected by gravity, resulting in the potential energy for a mass M to be linear in height h: Mgh.What relative concentrations will we have when two different packets of air are in equilibrium?If they are at the same height, we will have half the mass in one, and half the mass in the other, and the amount flowing from one to the other balances the amount flowing in the opposite direction.[0]If they are at differing heights, then a greater percentage of the higher air tends to descend than that percentage of the lower air which ascends.  In order for the two flows to balance, the higher packet must contain less air than the lower, and the mass balance of the flows corresponds thusly:    high percentage of thin air     ---------------------------     low percentage of dense airNow, rates are exponential in energy differences[1], so that theoretically we should expect an exponential decay in height, to compensate.  How does it go in practice?-Dave[0] How well does it balance?     Chemical equilibria seem      stable, as they deal with     very large numbers over a     very long time.  Economic     equilibria are viewed from     the mayfly standpoint of     individual people, and so,     at best, the shot noise is     very visible.[1] That is to say, rates will     be exponential in the free     energy differences between     endpoints and a transition     state.  We can ignore that     complication in this model. ",0

"dependency grammar : corrections , reactions , reformatting apparently i made a few mistakes in the posting about my manuscript on dependency grammar . this is curious , because i apparently got everything right on the earlier posting on the same topic to the dg and hpsg lists . at least two people have informed me that they successfully ftp-ed everything , but at least two others have had problems . the address should be : julius . ling . ohio-state . edu the suffixes . ps . gz on the file-names ( not the address ) indicate that they are compressed , so you need to uncompress them using the command &#x27; gunzip &#x27; . the slashes in the directory address should be &#x27; / &#x27; and not &#x27; \ &#x27; . presumably because of some sort of software error , i cannot read things in my inbox . but i put three of the reactions to my previous posting there before i had grown accustomed to this problem , so i cannot answer these directly , but will now try to do so through the linguist list . to the respondent from finland : you wanted a numerical address . it is : 128 . 146 . 172 . 200 to the respondent from taiwan ( or was it hongkong ? ) . you noted a problem with chapter 7 . the general problem has now been corrected , but there may still be a problem with one or two of the examples . if so , i can send an ascii file , as you suggested , or a paper copy of these examples , if you send me a regular mail address , but in either case you have to write to me again . i am now used to reading my mail and replying if necessary , or at least writing down the essential information , before downloading . nevertheless , i hope the compuserve people solve the problem soon . to the &quot; computer illiterate / dyslexic &quot; ( your own term ) : surely you can find someone there who is able to help you with the ftp procedure . the university you are at must have more than its share of experts in this area . but i can also send you an ascii version of chapter 1 via email , if you write to me again . for the sake of making my files more compatible with the software linguists most often use , andreas kathol has advised me to reformat my manuscript in latex . unfortunately , he does n&#x27;t know where to get a latex software packet for use with pcs ( what i use ) . can anyone help by giving me a site to ftp from ? i am in the process of creating a latex version of the files . dan maxwell 100101 , 2276 @ compuserve . com",0

"DEAR SIR/MADAMRE: BUSINESS ASSISTANCEI have decided to contact your assistance in relation to the following business proposal, having obtained your contact through the commercial attach of your country&#x27;s embassy in South Africa. This recommendation is based on the information that you will not betray the trust and confidence to be reposed in you. I am Romila Kabila the second son of the assassinated former President Of Democratic Republic Of Congo (D.C) Late Laurent Desire Kabila who on Tuesday 16 January   during the four years rule of my father I was his confidential/private security and base on my position of relationship of father and son. I was able to be in change of the president&#x27;s personal security vault and some of his savings.Now following the death of my father, the immediate family of the late President Kabila has met and concluded that some savings and security vault of the former President should be moved out of the troubled Democratic Republic of Congo with immediate president of Democratic republic of Congo by the late Kabila has been appointed president of democratic republic of Congo by the late kabila&#x27;s national executive council and the country top military brass, and properties worth millions of US$ to relocate the late president kabila&#x27;s assets and properties with millions of dollars  to over sea country where there is good political climate. We have concluded arrangement to move/transfer the sum US$42M to a finance and security company in London through a Diplomatic courier services. The family through a diplomatic contact during my father&#x27;s regime, conclude an arrangement to lodge/deposit the above sums with the GLOBAL DIPLOMATIC AND SECURITY SERVICES in LONDON - U.K! . And it is on this, that I am soliciting for your assistance to help us receive this amount from this security company once it arrives London upon your acceptance to assist in this project as we the family member can not do it on our own because of the code of conduct, which was introduced by my late father to checkmate excess embezzlement/siphoning of the Government/public funds overseas country as the case had be during the Late President Mobutu Sese Seko. So one cannot make law and destroy the same law. Therefore if you can render your assistance, please indicate your interest to me through my email romkabila@presidency.com, you should then urgently arrange to travel to London and clear the (consignments) funds upon it arrival and subsequent payment of the US$42M into your bank account. As soon as we hear from you, we then send a representative to be with you in London to represent our interest. Based on your anticipated efforts and contri! bution the family has resolved to give you 20% commission and the remaining 80% will be reclaimed by the family. It will be my pleasure to be able to co-operate with you on terms that you may wish for the successful completion of this project. Thanks and remain blessed.Best Regards, ROMILA KABILA ",1

If untrusted strangers are relaying spam through your qmail server, it&#x27;s a fair bet that you&#x27;ve seriously botched your qmail config (like forgetting to create an rcpthosts file or something).Anyway, if you insist on using razor to resolve this problem, I would suggest tossing qmail-scanner  and SpamAssassin  into the mix as well. The former provides the qmail-integration framework on which the latter does its work (including razor-check invocations).Fair warning: It&#x27;ll be far more resource-intensive than simply denying relaying privileges to everyone except the folks you trust.  To find out how to do that, go to  (which, incidentally, should be your first stop for all things qmail) and search for &quot;qmail newbie&#x27;s guide to relaying&quot;.- Adrian ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by: Dice - The leading online job board for high-tech professionals.

"Check out this. Its for compaq kit, but a pc&#x27;s a pc ;--)http://www.geocities.com/rlcomp_1999/procedures/kickstart-rh70.htmlThere are other articles too.Hope that helps,CW ---------------- How many Redhat admins out there use the redhat kickstart? If you don&#x27;t use it, how do you install redhat on all your  workstations, do you do it by hand, with the cds?As we are looking at using Linux at work, I&#x27;m looking into setting up the kickstart. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a lot of documentation around about it.Does anybody know if it would be possible to do the following: Get the machine to boot using DHCP and read it&#x27;s kickstart config file from teh DHCP server and in this config file have the machine configured to use a static IP, so that when the machine is rebooted it will come up with it&#x27;s new IP.Also, There was no driver on the redhat network install flopopy for the network card in the machine I&#x27;m installing. This required me to uncompress the floppy image, loop mount it, add in the module for the network card and compress it all up again. I&#x27;m not going to be able to do this every time we get a new machine, I was wondering if instead of having a boot floppy, you could use a boot cdrom, but just for the purpose of having all the network card modules on the cdrom. I&#x27;d still want it to get the packages from an NFS server on the network.Any help with this would be greatly appreciated, cheers, deccy.--  --------------------------------------- Declan Houlihan deccy@csn.ul.ie http://deccy.csn.ul.ie/ -----------------------------------------  Irish Linux Users&#x27; Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

"SUBJECT:                     Urgent Concern Pls.I am a serious officer with one of our main branches of CITI BANK, consumer Banking Department. Although we didn&#x27;t have previous correspondence till date. However, based on the standard value place on everything about you,  I believed we could discuss, analyze and execute this transaction.The transaction is thus: I&#x27;ve a wealthy client, an American Citizen who had been residing in West Africa for decades now, he operates a fix deposit account with us which I am his account officer, and also  receives standing orders  for his chains of dividends share. However, this client Mr. David Brown died as an  out come of Heart attack,and the funds in his current account has  been claimed by his family, who had gone back finally to USA. At the end of Fiscal year, March 2001, an  accumulated share of US$12.360M was transferred into his account from the Stock Exchange. This was alone the instructions we issued to the Stock House to dispose all his stocks.Now the funds has arrived, I needed an associate whom I would present as the inheritor of this fund i.e. Associate partner of Mr. David Brown so as to receive this fund. Please note, his family has left since,and never  know about this stocks in the exchange and the funds has subsequently matured in his Fix Deposit Account, so I as the account officer  has prepared all documents for easy claims of this fund. Immediately, you reach me, I will furnish you  with further details and then negotiate on the sharing ratio once you show your sincere involvement to go along with me. It will be of  need for you to furnish me also your personal phone and fax  numbers for urgent messages.  I am anxiously waiting to hear your consent. Be guided.Thanking you .Yours sincerely,Dave Framo. --  Irish Linux Users&#x27; Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

"poisoning diagnosis &#x27; rock solid &#x27; ( cnn ) - - the doctor who has overseen the treatment in vienna of ukrainian opposition leader viktor yushchenko says the diagnosis of dioxin poisoning is &quot; rock solid , &quot; but says more information must be obtained before medical authorities can determine the candidate &#x27; s prognosis . dr . michael zimpfer told cnn sunday that he based his conclusion on a physical examination of the patient and &quot; various blood tests &quot; carried out at vienna &#x27; s rudolfinerhaus clinic and elsewhere . zimpfer told reporters over the weekend that the concentration of dioxin in yushchenko &#x27; s body was &quot; 1 , 000 times above the normal levels &quot; and that he suspected &quot; third - party involvement . &quot; the revelation prompted ukraine &#x27; s prosecutor - general to reopen a probe into the opposition leader &#x27; s illness . &quot; we have sent samples to a lab within europe and also to labs across the atlantic ocean that claim to have vast experience , and they came up with the results , &quot; zimpfer told cnn late sunday . yushchenko has &quot; a tremendous amount of dioxin in the blood , &quot; zimpfer said , so much that &quot; it &#x27; s beyond the scale . &quot; yushchenko has accused ukrainian authorities of having tried to poison him in the run - up to november &#x27; s fraudulent presidential election . ukraine &#x27; s supreme court voided the outcome after yushchenko lost to prime minister viktor yanukovich , and a rerun of the contest is slated to be held on december 26 . the 50 - year - old , then - telegenic campaigner was taken to the vienna hospital in september , when he first fell ill . he resumed campaigning later in the month but with a pockmarked and badly disfigured face . given what little medical information has been released publicly , yushchenko could have been exposed to any of about 20 dioxins or dioxin - like chemicals , said dr . arnold schecter , professor of medicine at the university texas school of public health at southwestern medical center in dallas .",1

"&gt; From: bitbitch@magnesium.net [mailto:bitbitch@magnesium.net]&gt;  &gt; Burbank says the tax would reach only a pre-selected group of &gt; consumers who are wealthier than those who drink drip. So, he&#x27;s been &gt; pitching it as a modern-day Robin Hood tax, where the needy get a dime &gt; every time the affluent spend $3 to $4 on an espresso.The people who pour the espresso aren&#x27;t rich.  An interesting issue might be how it affects employment.Still, it is a 1% or less sales tax.  That might not make that big of a difference.  The costs of tracking revenue and collecting the tax might be onerous. Worse than the cost of the tax itself.Me: I hate coffee anyway.  But if they put a $.10/can tax on Diet Dr. Pepper I might have to start buying them in Oregon.  (Yes, I drink that much Diet Dr. Pepper). ",0

"I need to setup a VPN between a few sites. From what I&#x27;ve read, the the choices come down (on the Linux side) to IPsec (using FreeSWAN) or CIPE. It seems that FreeSWAN is &#x27;better&#x27;, being an implementation of IPsec which is a standard. However, CIPE does the job as well for Linux clients and is somewhat simpler to setup. The problem is that it&#x27;s not a pure Linux situation - a couple of the sites run OS-X. I&#x27;m pretty sure that I&#x27;ll be able to find an implementation of IPsec for OS-X, but I think CIPE is Linux only.So, the question is for those of you have have implemented BOTH - is there a significant difference in setup time and hassle between CIPE and FreeSWAN ? If CIPE is going to be much easier than dealing with FreeSWAN (and whatever on the OS-X sites) then I&#x27;ll simply get a Linux box for each of the remote sites - with the low price of hardware, it doesn&#x27;t take much more complexity in software to make buying hardware to use simpler software economic.Niall--  Irish Linux Users&#x27; Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

" Hi all,I have 3 or 4 email addresses (which get used for different reasons), and I&#x27;d prefer not to mix them up. So I was wondering if anyone knows of a way that I can have mail (apart from list mail, which I have already sorted) which arrives to a certain e-mail address have the From: header in the reply automatically set to the address it came to.For example, say I have a company, and sales@company.com, info@company.com and tech@company.com arrive in the same mailbox. I don&#x27;t want to reply to sales@company.com mails with the From: set to dave@company.com, I would like the mail to come from sales@company.com.Is there any way to do this? Bearing in mind that mail can arrive with my email in the To or Cc fields (and Bcc?), and it might be buried in a couple of dozen other recipients...Cheers, Dave.--         David Neary,     Marseille, France   E-Mail: bolsh@gimp.org--  Irish Linux Users&#x27; Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

At a recent function honoring America&#x27;s war widows, Bush sported a visible erection when his speech turned to the subject of the Middle East.&#x27;Believe me when I say this. With or without the help of other nations, with or without UN approval, we will penetrate Iraq&#x27;s borders. With overwhelming force, we will pound Iraq over and over again without ceasing. And, once its leaders concede defeat, we will seed Iraq with American-style democracy.&#x27;Aides say the podium was scrubbed down thoroughly after the event with a special cleanser/biocide not used since the Clinton administration.&quot;.....------------------------ Yahoo!

" &gt; MF&gt; I don&#x27;t think free speech is a license to speak directly at &gt; and be in the &gt; MF&gt; physical presence of any particular individual of your &gt; choosing - especially &gt; MF&gt; when that individual is busy doing something else and isn&#x27;t &gt; interested.Yep. I agree 100%&gt; &gt; Sure.  And that goes back to my second argument -- Cohen.   THey can &gt; walk away.   NObody compells them to stand there, I&#x27;ll agree fully. &gt; But we still have a Constitutional right to speak out against &gt; policies, actions and grievances. &gt; &gt; Again.  If you want it another way, lets change the Constitution.Huh?  Are you saying that whoever has the loudest voice gets to be heard? Shouting down a public speaker could be considered a form of censorship. If shouting down public speakers is &#x27;protected&#x27; it is only a matter of time before the people doing the shouting have their tactic used against them -every single time they open their mouth-. The tactic is stupid and non-productive and if generally used, will only result in chaos.  The tactic is just stupid ego-bation at best, unless the goal is to generate chaos. And humans whose goals and actions in life are to create chaos in society should be locked up (provided you can accurately identify them, which is not really possible anyway, but hey, this is my rant :-).

The technique works for input  values between 0 and 1 and supports large exponents. The presented shader does  not require any texture look-up and is scalable, making it possible to spend  more instructions in order to decrease the error or to reach greater exponents. ",0

" Forwarded-by: Rob Windsor  Forwarded-by: LZ A pastor walked into a neighborhood pub.  The place was hopping with music and dancing but every once in a while the lights would turn off.  Each time after the lights would go out the place would erupt into cheers.However, when the revelers saw the town pastor, the room went dead silent.  He walked up to the bartender and asked, &quot;May I please use the restroom?&quot;The bartender replied, &quot;I really don&#x27;t think you should.&quot;&quot;Why not?&quot; the pastor asked.&quot;Well, there is a statue of a naked woman in there, and her most private part is covered only by a fig leaf.&quot;&quot;Nonsense,&quot; said the pastor, &quot;I&#x27;ll just look the other way.&quot;So the bartender showed the clergyman the door at the top of the stairs, and he proceeded to the restroom.  After a few minutes, he came back out, and the whole place was hopping with music and dancing again.  However, they did stop just long enough to give the pastor a loud round of applause.  He went to the bartender and said, &quot;Sir, I don&#x27;t understand.  Why did they applaud for me just because I went to the restroom?&quot;&quot;Well, now they know you&#x27;re one of us,&quot; said the bartender.  &quot;Would you like a drink?&quot;&quot;But, I still don&#x27;t understand,&quot; said the puzzled pastor.&quot;You see,&quot; laughed the bartender, &quot;every time the fig leaf is lifted on the statue, the lights go out in the whole place.  Now, how about that drink?&quot; ",0

"I attended the same conference, and was impressed by a few systems that Jim didn&#x27;t mention. In terms of CMS, the following all had apparently been used in some fairly large implementations and looked like some pretty strong competition to commercial systems: - Midgard, http://www.midgard-project.org/ , a PHP-based content management framework that with other programs combines to be a full CMS - Redhat CCM CMS, Java-based: http://www.spamassassin.taint.org/software/ccm/cms/ - OpenCMS, Java-based: http://www.opencms.orgThere was agreement that usability has not generally been an open source strength, but both Plone and Xopus represented some real movement towards improving that situation.I was impressed by the spectrum of perspectives on XML. Some took for granted that XSLT was relevant to content management, others took it just as for granted that XSLT was irrelevant and seemed happy to ignore XML almost completely. I attended realizing that &quot;content management&quot; is generally used to apply to *Web* content management, but I was still a bit shocked how completely out of scope document management was (almost no consideration of the potential print/PDF dimension to content other than the occasional &quot;...and you can use FOP to make PDF&quot; as if that was functional): this seems more the case in open source content management than in commercial content management, and probably makes XML easier to ignore (if HTML is the be-all and end-all of the output...).The honesty was refreshing, Phil Suh complained about the state of current tools (both open source and commercial), and I wish I&#x27;d written down what he said, something like &quot;it sucks so extremely, it sucks so widely, and it is so generally sucking, that it seems sometimes there is no hope.&quot; For a moment there was contemplation that perhaps commercial systems scaled so well that the commercial &quot;big boys&quot; were really much more functional than open source, until someone pointed out, &quot;OK, take some average blog software, spend $500,000 on the rollout... it&#x27;ll scale pretty well.&quot; Another quote (citing Brendan Quinn): &quot;content management problems are either trivial or impossible.&quot;Mac OS X is getting popular, of the laptops there it was an even 1/3 each of Mac, Linux, Windows.I am sure it wasn&#x27;t news to Jim, but I can&#x27;t wait to try Subversion, a CVS replacement that supports some of the newer features of WebDAV: http://subversion.tigris.org/I&#x27;m also eager to try Xopus, I hope the developers make it back home safely, they said they&#x27;d only been in America four days but were already homeless...Max",0

"When a settler goes postal and kills some Palestinians they are treated as a criminal, not celebrated in word and song.But you knew that.When a Palestinian sets out, to great rejoicing, to attempt to target children with a homicide-bomb, they are careful to dip the shrapnel in rat poison.  It helps prevent blood clotting in the victims, you see.I&#x27;m sure all those Jewish homicide-bombers do the same.  Oh wait, there aren&#x27;t any.If the Palestinians are driven completely out, either by expulsion or death, they will have nobody to blame but themselves.  That won&#x27;t stop them or you from pretending otherwise. &gt; From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of Owen &gt; Byrne &gt; I&#x27;m sure the plan is that it will be renamed for the settler who kills &gt; the last Palestinian in a few years. &gt;  &gt; Owen &gt; ",0

The main way that  spammers hide their originating IPs is not by forging headers,  but by sending through open proxy servers.  It used to be that  spammers used open relay mailserver, but these often betray the  originating IP, and the proliferation of open relay blocklists,  and the introduction of port 25 blocking on the part of many  ISPs make open relays unattractive to spammers.One would think, that the combination of a forged Habeas-SWE,  and mail sent through an anonymizing open proxy would be a  fairly good indication of spam.

"http://www.informationwave.net/news/20020819riaa.php   IWT Bans RIAA From Accessing Its NetworkAugust 19, 2002Information Wave Technologies has announced it will actively deny the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) from accessing the contents of its network. Earlier this year, the RIAA announced its new plan to access computers without owner&#x27;s consent for the sake of protecting its assets. Information Wave believes this policy puts its customers at risk of unintentional damage, corporate espionage, and invasion of privacy to say the least.Due to the nature of this matter and RIAA&#x27;s previous history, we feel the RIAA will abuse software vulnerabilities in a client&#x27;s browser after the browser accesses its site, potentially allowing the RIAA to access and/or tamper with your data. Starting at midnight on August 19, 2002, Information Wave customers will no longer be able to reach the RIAA&#x27;s web site. Information Wave will also actively seek out attempts by the RIAA to thwart this policy and apply additional filters to protect our customers&#x27; data.Information Wave will also deploy peer-to-peer clients on the Gnutella network from its security research and development network (honeynet) which will offer files with popular song titles derived from the Billboard Top 100 maintained by VNU eMedia. No copyright violations will take place, these files will merely have arbitrary sizes similar to the length of a 3 to 4 minute MP3 audio file encoded at 128kbps. Clients which connect to our peer-to-peer clients, and then afterwards attempt to illegally access the network will be immediately blacklisted from Information Wave&#x27;s network. The data collected will be actively maintained and distributed from our network operations site.The placement of this policy is not intended to hamper the RIAA&#x27;s piracy elimination agenda or advocate Internet piracy, but to ensure the safety of our customers&#x27; data attached to our network from hackers or corporate espionage hidden by the veil of RIAA copyright enforcement.If you have questions, comments, or concerns regarding this policy, please e-mail riaa@informationwave.net. --  ----------------- R.

"&gt; &gt; Is the use of &quot;trusted hardware&quot; really worth it ? &gt; &gt; Answering that requires fairly complete knowledge of the business &gt; model. But, in all probability: no, it isn&#x27;t usually worth it. So, it &gt; comes down to how difficult you want to make the cracker&#x27;s job. &gt; &gt; &gt; Look at the DVDs. &gt; &gt; IIRC, CSS was cracked by reverse-engineering a software player; and &gt; one where the developers forgot to encrypt the decryption key at that.This make me wonder about the relative protection of smart cards.  They have  an internal procession unit around 4MHz.  Can we consider them as trusted  hardware ?  The ability to ship smart cards periodicaly uppon cashing of a  monthly subscription fee would not raise too much the cost of &quot;renting&quot; the  system.  Smart card do their own self encryption.  Can they be used to  decrypt data needed by the system ?  The input of the system could me mangled  and the would keep a reference of how long it was in service.This sounds really feasible but I may be totaly wrong.  I may also be wrong  about the safety of a smart card.  What do you think ?--  Yannick Gingras Coder for OBB : Oceangoing Bared Bonanza http://OpenBeatBox.org ",0

"pleased to meet you ! hola ! tot kijkfrustrated love has been the incentive for many great works . thou unassuming common - place of nature , with that homely face . they say you can &#x27; t do it , but sometimes it doesn &#x27; t always work . the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams . in suggesting gifts : money is appropriate , and one size fits all . sooner or later everyone sits down to a banquet of consequences . love can heal a broken heart . football strategy does not originate in a scrimmage : it is useless to expect solutions in a political campaign . failure is the path of least persistence injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere . honest criticism is hard to take , especially from a relative , a friend , an acquaintance , or a stranger . you can learn many things from children . how much patience you have , for instance . my ancestors didn &#x27; t come over on the mayflower , but they were there to meet the boat . i teach that all men are mad . do not judge , and you will never be mistaken . it &#x27; s funny , isn &#x27; t it ? how your best friend can just blow up like that ? do not speak of your happiness to one less fortunate than yourself . historian . a broad - - gauge gossip .",1

They seem like an awfully &gt;     J&gt; nice bunch of chaps (and chapesses). &gt;  &gt; Yes, them too.  When wolves attack their sheep, they coral the wolf &gt; into a quarry and then throw rocks from the surrounding cliffs so &gt; that &quot;no one will know who killed the wolf&quot; &gt;  &gt; In Samskar, before the Chinese arrived, there had not been a killing &gt; in over 2000 years, and the last recorded skirmish, over rights to &gt; a water hole, had happened several generations ago. I&#x27;m skeptical.  One of the many perversions of modern civilization is the fictitious rendering of various peoples, frequently to the point where the fiction is more &quot;real&quot; than the reality.  You see it over and over again in history:  The Primitive People pull a fast one on Whitey The Junior Anthropologist, playing to all the prejudices of Whitey (who only became Junior Anthropologists to support personal ideologies), and before you know it the charade takes on a life of its own which the Primitive People are compelled to perpetuate.  Worse, even when there is substantial evidence to the contrary with some basic scholarship, the facts have a hard time competing with the ideologically pleasing fiction that is already firmly entrenched.  And many peoples (e.g. American Indians) develop a profit motive for maintaining and promoting the myth in popular culture.I&#x27;m far more inclined to believe that people is people, no matter where you are on the planet.  The only time you see any anomalies is when you have a self-selecting sub-population within an otherwise normal population, which is hardly a fair way to look at any major population.-James Rogers  jamesr@best.com",0

"subcategorization in tranformational grammar dear colleagues , i &#x27; m wondering if someone could give me some pointers to the latest literature in transformational grammar ( gb , p&amp;p , minimalism ) that deals with issues of subcategorization . in particular i would like to get a sense of the latest thinking , including ways in which minimalism departs from previous assumptions . among the questions that i would ideally like to see addressed are the following : - what kind of subcategorization relations have been assumed in the recent literature , and for what kinds of phenomena ? for instance , a transitive verb must somehow encode the requirement of taking a dp complement . but can a verb also take a pp complement according to the identity of that pp &#x27;s head ( as in _ rely _ + _ on _ ) ? - how are subcategorization relations constrained ? that is , what syntactic ( or semantic ) properties are thought to be accessible ( in the limit ) to the selecting head ? - if there are substantive formal constraints on subcategorization , where do they come from ? is there anything in the architecture of the theory from which such constraints would follow ? thanks very much , - - andreas kathol",0

"Definitional nit to pick:Robert Harley writes: &gt; It is perfectly obvious that (heterosexual) promiscuity is exactly, &gt; precisely identical between males and females. &gt;  &gt; Of course the shapes of the distributions may differ.You&#x27;ve redefined &quot;promiscuity&quot; above as &quot;total&quot; or &quot;average&quot;  activity, which seems to rob it of its common meaning:  activity above some specific threshold (usually &quot;one&quot;) or  norm, or involving extra or indiscriminate variety.  &quot;Promiscuity&quot; is thus inherently a description of  distributions rather than averages.Consider a population of 3 males and 3 females. Let there be three pairings which result in each person having sex once. Then, let one of the males also have  sex with the other two females. Sure, the average number of sex acts and sex partners is equal between the sexes, tautologically. But here more women than men are:  - above the single partner threshold  - above the overall average 1.67 acts/partners threshold  - above the overall median 1.5 acts/partners  - above the overall mode 1 acts/partnersAnd here women have a higher mode (2) and median (2)  number of partners.So in this contrived population, females are more  &quot;promiscuous&quot; than males, unless &quot;promiscuity&quot; is  defined uselessly.- Gordon ",0

RDF adds another layer of  tedium, but there are still a few folks willing to write it by hand. I make  heavy use of reification/quoting in my representation of logical formulas in  RDF.

"Cheers, Adam.Perhaps people are starting to notice how profit motive drains the  meaning out of their lives. Kinda sucks to be an ant farming for the  corporate lords. Funny how most of the rest of the world is more and  more apprehensive towards American Democracy.I just went to DC for the first time. I was awestruck by the  monuments, the words of Thomas Jefferson, the Spirit of Democracy set  in stone. Amazing to think that in little more than 200 years our  government could be so far removed from those honorable principles.  Adam Smith presumed that the marketplace would regulate itself  through morality, good faith, and responsibility. Corporate America  seems to feel that those principles stand in the way of making the  real bucks. How much more can they co-opt and commodify? Get your  copyrights in quick so you can hold on to your piece of the pie.  Health care, public programs, pensions, social security - these are  now regarded as worthless unless they can turn a profit.Ah, socialized medicine. Siestas. 6 week vacation leave.

"As yet another wave of people I know seem to have lost their jobs last week, here is the latest in what I&#x27;m seeing...* Even knowing a CTO/CEO/CFO may not even get your resume looked at, the feedback I&#x27;m getting is that hiring managers are only considering family and extended family for jobs - everyone has plenty of unemployed relatives.* Most job sites are now almost empty - so the practice of posting &quot;resume bait&quot; jobs is coming to an end. The postings they do have are months old bait. This is now a completely pointless way to look for a job.* We&#x27;re almost flatlne in jobs created for several months, where population growth needs about 120k jobs a month to keep things steady.* Unemployment rates are only staying steady becasue people drop out of the workforce number after they cant find a job for a long time. The &quot;not in labor force&quot; is rising 400k a month. International numbers are no better - technology is replacing people, especially the people tha tmake the technoogy.* Grad school programs are stuffed full of people for every non-tech major. Colleges are having big headaches dealing with all the day-job refugees.* Spam for porn, ink, and stocks has dropped off, spam (the english ones I see subject lines for) now seems to be dominated by work-at-home scams and resume services.

"update - reimbursement of individually billed items the use of cell phones and pagers has increased dramatically in the past few years . as a result the accounts payable department has seen a rapid increase in the number of invoices and vendors . with the higher volume , we have reviewed our processes in order to continue our rapid payment cycle . although we encourage vendors to address their invoices to individual employees , they often mail invoices directly to accounts payable . at times they fail to list the individual who uses the pager or cell phone . in these cases we return the invoice to the vendor . if the employee is designated , we try to track him / her down and forward the invoice . the high level of employee movement among jobs and locations at enron has made this increasingly challenging . either way , we end up doing something less productive than paying invoices . to maintain satisfactory response to our vendors and to reduce time necessary for research , we request that employees who have pagers , cell phones , and other individually billed items such as licenses , subscriptions , etc . , pay for them by personal check or charge card ( if applicable  * payment instructions are usually indicated on the invoice ) and request reimbursement through employee expense reports . by submitting these charges on your expense report , you can help us reduce the amount of time spent researching and forwarding invoices , the number of checks generated by treasury , the number of vendors in our database , and the turnaround time for payment of invoices . incidentally , accounts payable is currently installing a corporate - wide web - based expense reporting system similar to what enron international has used for the past year . this will make it even easier to file your expense report and receive quick reimbursement . we  , d like to make this effective immediately . if you have any questions or suggestions , please contact the accounts payable department .",0

Why? Neither party is inaccurate in their &gt; actions IMO. But someone&#x27;s standing is going to get hurt because of &gt; it.My question for the trust system is this. I signed up for a free accounton some website that gives me free access to a large compilation of data, and in so doing have subscribed myself to their mailing list. The mailing includes a list of new articles and books and so forth as well as a few links to their book store.This is consistently flagged as spam, even though I *agreed* to see it, and I *want* to see what new articles there are, since some of them might be interesting. Thus, since it is certifiably *not* spam (it even includes a link to terminate your account), I revoke it. Even so, the next mail is still flagged as spam.Who is losing a trust rating here?

" Forwarded-by: Chris Wedgwood  From: Bert01. I was so poor growing up...  if I wasn&#x27;t a boy...  I&#x27;d have had     nothing to play with.02. A girl phoned me the other day and said, &quot;Come on over; nobody&#x27;s     home.&quot;  I went over. Nobody was home.03. During sex, my girlfriend always wants to talk to me.  Just the     other night she called me from a hotel04. One day I came home early from work...  I saw a guy jogging     naked. I said to the guy, &quot;Hey buddy, why are you doing that?&quot;  He     said &quot;Because you came home early.&quot;05. It&#x27;s been a rough day. I got up this morning...  put a shirt on     and button fell off.  I picked up my briefcase, and the handle     came off.  I&#x27;m afraid to go to the bathroom.06. I was such an ugly kid...  When I played in the sandbox, the cat     kept covering me up.07. I could tell my parents hated me.  My bath toys were a toaster and     radio.08. I was such an ugly baby...  My mother never breast fed me. She     told me that she only liked me as a friend.09. I&#x27;m so ugly...  My father carries around a picture of the kid who     came with his wallet.10. When I was born, the doctor came into the waiting room and said to     my father, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry. We did everything we could, but he pulled     through.&quot;11. I&#x27;m so ugly...  My mother had morning sickness...  AFTER I was     born.12. I remember the time that I was kidnapped and they sent a piece of     my finger to my father.  He said he wanted more proof.13. Once when I was lost, I saw a policeman, and asked him to help me     find my parents. I said to him, &quot;Do you think we&#x27;ll ever find     them?&quot; He said,&quot;I don&#x27;t know kid. There&#x27;s so many places they can     hide.&quot;14. My wife made me join a bridge club. I jump off next Tuesday.15. I&#x27;m so ugly...  I worked in a pet shop, and people kept asking how     big I&#x27;d get.16. I went to see my doctor. &quot;Doctor, every morning when I get up and     I look in the mirror...  I feel like throwing up; What&#x27;s wrong     with me?&quot; He said...  &quot;I don&#x27;t know but your eyesight is perfect.&quot;17. I went to the doctor because I&#x27;d swallowed a bottle of sleeping     pills. My doctor told me to have a few drinks and get some rest.18. With my old man I got no respect. I asked him, &quot;How can I get my     kite in the air?&quot; He told me to run off a cliff.19. Some dog I got. We call him Egypt because in every room he leaves     a pyramid. His favorite bone is in my arm.  Last night he went on     the paper four times - three of those times I was reading it.20. One year they wanted to make me poster boy - for birth control.21. My uncle&#x27;s dying wish was to have me sitting in his lap; he was in     the electric chair. ",0

"  Quoting Ronan Waide :    &gt; Sure, but soft links would do the same. To be honest, I&#x27;m trying to  &gt; think of a useful use of hard links right now, and I&#x27;m a little  &gt; stumped. There&#x27;s gotta be some benefit that I&#x27;m missing that&#x27;s  &gt; immediately obvious to everyone.No there doesn&#x27;t :-) . The Bell labs Unix people implemented hard links, whereas Bill Joy and co. at Berkeley implemented soft links, five years later, mainly to get around not being able to do cross-device hard linking, as I understand it. Soft links are fairly classic Berkeley hackery (cf. gethostbyname, h_errno, and the resultant problems implementing mt-safe interfaces); they do what they were intended for, but break fairly easily, in this case when the target file was deleted. For a better design for similar ideas, see the MacOS.--  I&#x27;m not a pheasant plucker / I&#x27;m a pheasant plucker&#x27;s son.

Years ago, to my five &gt; year old brain, my dad used to inform me that I had &#x27;smegma&#x27; in my &gt; eye, and would proceed to extricate it. I don&#x27;t think there is a specific word in English for eye goop.  However, when I was halfway literate in Tagalog, I learned that there is a specific word in that language (or was it another dialect?) for it: muta, pronounced &quot;MOO-ta&quot;.  Even though my Tagalog has faded greatly, I automatically use that word for &quot;eye goop&quot; when speaking English (how often does that happen?), mostly because it apparently filled a linguistic hole in my brain and therefore permanently wedged itself into my vocabulary.Not that this is important, but I&#x27;ve inadvertently adopted &quot;muta&quot; into my version of the English language as the word for &quot;eye goop&quot;.  Arguably better than &quot;smegma&quot; anyway.(Definitely Friday...)-James Rogers  jamesr@best.comhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork ",0

"http://www.therockalltimes.co.uk/2002/04/08/new-tags.htmlW3C approves HTML 4 &#x27;emotitags&#x27; - Now you&#x27;ll be able to say it with feeling by Lester HainesThe World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has approved a number of new html &#x27;emotitags&#x27; which will revolutionise the web surfing experience.The tags have no physical effect, but rather elicit a strong emotional response from the reader. Top of the list is  (War on TerrorT). The tag, when judiciously applied, will immediately provoke violent anger against ragheads, thus:Charity agencies report that Iraqi leader Sadaam Hussein has adopted the African dictatorial habit of eating his political opponents.Of particular interest to British code-monkeys is the new  (I&#x27;m hurting too). This is designed for use when reporting on the life of Elizabeth the Queen Mother and other recently dead famous people:She touched our lives in so many ways with her common touch and her instinctive understanding of ordinary people. She will be sadly missed.The instantaneous effect is to reduce the reader to teary-eyed and self-indulgent wallowing in which he or she becomes unaccountably upset about the death of a complete stranger.Political reporting also looks to benefit from the new  tag. Any government ministerial pronouncement is thus rendered immediately transparent:Tony Blair was quick to defend transport secretary Byers, calling him &quot;the most honest man it has been my privilege to know&quot;.And, in a much-needed boost to satire sites, W3C has formally ratified the controversial . This guarantees any text contained within it complete immunity from prosecution:Naomi Campbell, we can confirm, is a talentless, drug-addicted perjurer who believes that good looks alone can justify her appalling and obnoxious behaviour.The new tags have been warmly received by the programming community. W3C has, however, warned that they are to be used economically. It has further cautioned that they should never be used together, since the effect on the reader could be catastrophic:In response to reports that the Queen Mother had fallen victim to Sadaam Hussein&#x27;s Axis of EvilT chemical weapons programme, Stephen Byers noted: &quot;She was everybody&#x27;s favourite grandmother who touched the lives of billions. The only consolation we can gain from this tragedy is that all of the UK&#x27;s trains will be running on time by next Monday. And you can quote me on that.&quot;http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork ",0

"&gt; Ultimately, there was a big &gt; disagreement about how to sell the product (sales guys wanted to sell &gt; the thing for a gazillion dollars to megaclients, but we thought it &gt; would make more sense to get more people using it so we could get more &gt; feedback from many different places).  The bottom line was that the &gt; route we wound up going (megaclients for megabucks) had a megalong &gt; sales cycle.  The sales force staffed up and tried to sell the &gt; earliest releases of the software -- even succeeding in a few &gt; significant cases -- but couldn&#x27;t get enough to cover their own &gt; expenses, much less the actual development of the product.Now where have I seen that before.... oh yeah... its happening to me right now...",0

I just remember a lunch in Spain with a semi-famous American - I think we had about 10 nationalities at the  table, and he managed to insult each of them within 15 minutes. A historical perspective makes me think that empires -  Roman, British, Russian, American, whatever - produce  a larger proportion of assholes than subject nations (and are more  likely to have them in positions of authority).

"URL: http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/09/25#medicalNotes Date: Wed, 25 Sep 2002 12:49:48 GMTMixed news from yesterday&#x27;s heart checkup. First, I went seven minutes on the treadmill. That was pretty good. My heart  was racing like it hadn&#x27;t since I was in college. They also did an extensive  ultrasound on my carotid arteries[1], they&#x27;re in the neck and supply my head  with blood. More good news there. They&#x27;re clear, free of plaque, healthy, not  diseased[2]. So it appears I just have coronary artery disease, not general  artery disease. That&#x27;s good because there would be a risk of stroke if they  were sick, and not a whole lot they can do about it (as they can with the  heart). Now there was some not-good news. A small part of my heart isn&#x27;t working very  well. There are a few possible reasons for that, some fixable, some not. I  asked the doctor, does this mean I&#x27;m going to die sooner, and he said no. Does  it mean I have to restrict what I do, he said no. So what does it mean? Really  not much, other than I should watch, as before, for recurring symptoms, the  ones that brought me into the hospital in June. If they come back, we&#x27;ll do an  angiogram, and maybe an angioplasty, but the likelihood of another bypass  because of this is small. That&#x27;s quite a relief. I don&#x27;t like the idea of part  of my heart not working, but what can you do about it?[1] http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;safe=off&amp;q=carotid+arteries&amp;spell=1 [2] http://www.vascularweb.org/doc/190 ",0

Either these folks are social misfits who have no &gt; understanding of &gt; &gt; human interactions (else they would try more constructive means &gt; to get their &gt; &gt; message across) or they are just out to get their rocks off &gt; regardless of &gt; &gt; how it affects other people, and that is immoral at best and &gt; downright evil &gt; &gt; at worst. &gt; &gt; Are you kidding? It was fucking BRILLIANT. Do you know what &gt; exposure that got &gt; them? They sat perfectly so that the cameras could focus on the mildly &gt; exasperated Rumsfeld and their &quot;UN Inspections not war&quot; banner.What I am specifically referring to is protesters shouting down speakers or making so much noise that it interferes with the speaker. That&#x27;s wrong, immoral and unethical no matter what the political bent of the speakers and the protesters. Rowdy protests in their own venue (on a college campus or some of the commons areas of DC) is perfectly fine by me. Waving signs to get attention is fine.&gt; That picture &gt; will be dominating the news cycles in China, Iraq, Russia, Germany, and &gt; France, at least. For goodness sakes, you&#x27;re arguing about it on FoRK. In &gt; politics by sound-bite, those two rude hags kicked ass and took names. &gt; &gt; For the record, I don&#x27;t think they even got arrested, which is a shame.Well, Owen implied the protesters were arrested. Was he just jacking himself off at the expense of other people? Exactly why is it a shame that they were not arrested? Think about what you are saying and what you are telegraphing about your state of mind here. You WANT people to do bad things (ie, police arresting peaceful protesters) if it can help you further your cause? That attitude just sucks. You have no moral ground to stand on if that is what you believe.&gt; It is part of the game -- make an ass of yourself, get your point on &gt; the nightly &gt; news, spend a couple days in the clink for disorderly.Sure, just don&#x27;t whine about getting arrested if you make it a point to get in someone&#x27;s face.One other comment... Most of the people that are protesting against taking out the Iraqi dictator wouldn&#x27;t give a rats ass if a nuke went off in NYC. They simply wouldn&#x27;t care so why in the hell should the Americal public listen to them on matters of national security?So enlighten me, exactly why shouldn&#x27;t Hussein be taken out? And if your answr boils down to &quot;i don&#x27;t give a shit about what happens to the US&quot;, you can kiss my ass :-)Bill ",0

And since there isn&#x27;t  &gt; millions of different spam (it&#x27;s always the same ones coming  &gt; back over and over with maybe one or two different words, i.e.  &gt; the same mail if fuzzy signatures work well), I guess that  &gt; spammer will reach there limit pretty quickly.I was thinking you could easily create a spamtrap which you  subscribe to lots of legitimate nonspam mailing lists, plus you  also spread the email address around and get it in the hands of  lots of spammers so it ends up receiving large quantities of  both spam and nonspam, then you have it apply the algorithm  above to the incoming mail stream.  So it could be thousands of  actual real, different, emails per day.  The &quot;very high rate  triggers alarms&quot; thing is certainly something which would be  possible to check for, but there may be legitimate ways to  exhibit this behavior -- can&#x27;t think of one right now but &quot;AOL  proxy server&quot; springs to mind as an example from another domain.C------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by: Dice - The leading online job board for high-tech professionals.

"Quoting Paul Linehan (plinehan@yahoo.com):&gt; The point here is that (under French law) the author can change the &gt; terms of the licence arbitarily. This is because any granting of &gt; rights by an author must be clearly delimited in terms of how long, &gt; where, to whom, dates and times.The GPL and similar licences are explicitly permanent grants of rights attached to an instance of his work.  (The other stuff mentioned concerns contract law, e.g., the required element of privity, etc.)&gt; In the absence of such limitations, the original author has the right &gt; to change his software back to closed on a whim.No, the author has the right to issue _additional_ instances under a different licence, such as a proprietary (&quot;closed&quot; [sic]) licence.  &gt; Rick Moen makes the point that it is not a sale but rather a granting &gt; of rights which are not default.  &gt;  &gt; See the bit about even the granting of rights by an author having to &gt; be explicitly specified - under French law.The analysis, here and elsewhere, concerns contract law.  This isn&#x27;t contract law.This isn&#x27;t the first time copyright attorneys have stumbled on this subject.  I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t be the last.--  Cheers,              &quot;The front line of defense against such sophisticated  Rick Moen            viruses is a continually evolving computer operating  rick@linuxmafia.com  system that attracts the efforts of eager software                      developers.&quot;  -- Bill Gates          --  Irish Linux Users&#x27; Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

"die offs in areas with better records parallel and support the claims that European diseases were devastating to all American hemisphere populations, and the reverse was never true. Unlike, for example, India or Asia.There is a hot dispute about the original size of the indigenous population, but the evidence for a high density in the Mexican area is sound. It was up here in the North or in the Amazon where I&#x27;m a little more suspicious of very high upward revisions.At least that was my take.I have never heard anyone seriously argue that European diseases were not a significant factor, or that there were not in fact a lot of Aztec people prior to Cortez. Gee, I&#x27;ve never before heard someone argue unseriously about it either.Do you have a reference for a book or article which does so?&gt; -----Original Message----- &gt; From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of Robert &gt; Harley &gt; Sent: Sunday, August 18, 2002 4:57 PM &gt; To: fork@spamassassin.taint.org &gt; Cc: rah@shipwright.com &gt; Subject: Re: Al&#x27;Qaeda&#x27;s fantasy ideology: Policy Review no. 114 &gt; &gt; &gt;See Jared Diamond&#x27;s excellent &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot; for the story. &gt; &gt; Yeah, I know the party line. The evidence for it is extremely meagre. &gt; New Worlders had two entire continents and tens of millions of people, &gt; which is a plenty big enough reservoir for infectious diseases to thrive &gt; in.

"books on semantics john benjamins publishing would like to call your attention to the following new title in the field of semantics : nominal classification in aboriginal australia marc harvey &amp; nicholas reid ( eds . ) university of newcastle / university of new england 1997 . x , 296 pp . studies in language companion series , 37 us / canada : hb : 1 55619 848 5 price : usd 89 . 00 rest of the world : hb : 90 272 3040 4 price : nlg 178 , - - this volume aims to extend both the range of analyses and the database on nominal classification systems . previous analyses of nominal classification systems have focused on two areas : the semantics of the classification system and the role of the system in discourse . in many nominal classification systems , there appear to be a significant percentage of nominals with an arbitrary classification . there is a considerable body of literature aimed at elucidating the semantic bases of classification in such systems , thereby reducing the degree of apparent arbitrariness . contributors to this volume continue this line of enquiry , but also propose that arbitrariness in itself has a role from a wider socio-cultural perspective . previous analyses of the discourse role of classification systems posit that they play a significant role in referential tracking . for the languages surveyed in this volume , contributors propose that reference instantiation is an equally significant function , and indeed that reference instantiation and tracking cannot be properly divided from one another . this volume provides detailed information on classification in a number of northern australian languages , whose systems are otherwise poorly known . contents : introduction ; nominal classification and gender in aboriginal australia ; new guinea &#x27; classificatory verbs &#x27; and australian noun classification : a typological comparison ; head classes and agreement classes in the mayali dialect chain ; head and agreement classes : an areal perspective ; class and classifier in ngan &#x27; gityemerri ; nominal classification in marrithiyel ; noun classes , nominal classification and generics in murrinhpatha . contributions by : mark harvey ; nicholas reid ; fransesca merlin ; steve powell robert ; alan rumsey ; nicholas evans ; ian green ; michael walsh . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - bernadette martinez - keck tel : ( 215 ) 836-1200 publicity / marketing fax : ( 215 ) 836-1204 john benjamins north america e-mail : bernie @ benjamins . com po box 27519 philadelphia pa 19118-0519 check out the john benjamins web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com",0

"Once upon a time, Daniel wrote :&gt; &gt; Well, the 7.3 binary should work as long as you install the &quot;rpm404&quot; &gt; &gt; (IIRC) compatibility library. The only problem I have with some rpm 4.1 &gt; &gt; versions is that it sometimes hangs at the and of operations (-e, -i, &gt; &gt; -F or -U) and the only workaround is to kill it, &quot;rm -f &gt; &gt; /var/lib/rpm/__*&quot; and try again. &gt;  &gt; Well, you&#x27;re lucky if it sometimes works for you.  Mine hang all the  &gt; time, have to kill &#x27;em with -9.  And after that, rpm doesn&#x27;t work at all  &gt; (hangs right after i run the command, prints nothing).  Have to reboot  &gt; the machine to get anything rpm-related to work again.After that &quot;kill -9&quot;, removing the &quot;__*&quot; files in /var/lib/rpm/ and trying again works 100% of the time for me.

"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85531557 Date: Not suppliedDisney&#x27;s themepark business is in deep trouble in the post-9/11 world. A war  with Iraq could really kill &#x27;em:     While aggressively adding attractions, Disney boosted its profit by      steadily raising admission prices. The strategy worked, helping deliver      record profit for Disney year after year.     &quot;The strategy was build, build, build. Every year there was something new,&quot;      said David Koenig, a Disney historian and author. &quot;It was an astounding      growth period.... Now they&#x27;re overexposed.&quot;...     Theme park operating income for Disney this year is expected to fall 27% to      $1.16 billion, said Prudential Securities analyst Katherine Styponias. By      2003, she said, the business could climb to $1.49 billion, depending on      whether the U.S. goes to war with Iraq.

When did this happen? I wonder where the media gets the &gt; idea that the wealth gap is widening and deepening...All the world loves a smartass...:-).Seriously. Look at he life expectancy and human carrying capacity of this continent before the Europeans got here. Look at it now. Even for descendants of the original inhabitants. Even for the descendents of slaves, who were brought here by force.More stuff, cheaper. That&#x27;s progress.Poverty, of course, is not relative. It&#x27;s absolute. Disparity in wealth has nothing to do with it.It&#x27;s like saying that groups have rights, when, in truth, only individuals do. Like group rights, &quot;disparity&quot; in wealth is statistical sophistry. Besides, even if you can&#x27;t help the distribution, industrial wealth is almost always transitory, and so is relative poverty, even when there are no confiscatory death-taxes. The 20th anniversary Forbes 400 just came out, and only a few tens of people are still there since 1982, a time which had significantly higher marginal taxes on wealth, income, and inheritance than we do now. More to the point, they&#x27;re nowhere near the top.I&#x27;ll take those odds. It is only when neofeudalism reasserts itself, in the form of government regulation, confiscatory taxes, legislated monopoly, corporate welfare, &quot;non-profit&quot; neoaristocratic tax dodges, and legalized labor extortion that we get slowdowns in progress, like what happened in Fabian-era Britain, or 1970&#x27;s USA.In fact, it is in countries where wealth is the most &quot;unfairly&quot; distributed, that you get the most improvement in the general -- economic -- welfare. More stuff cheaper, fewer people dying, more people living longer.I&#x27;ll take those odds as well. People take greater risks when the returns are higher, improving the lot of us all as a result.Cheers, RAH-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: PGP 7.5iQA/AwUBPYy3ysPxH8jf3ohaEQLqNQCg14YvF8NVYwKiRrghHdisBoNCOn8AoPcR QUzorXeaLe5h3T1syKl7DFNT =9kff -----END PGP SIGNATURE-------  ----------------- R.

The regime and even the present civilian government are made up of Abacha&#x27;s enemies.Recently, the wife was banned from traveling outside Kano State their home state as a kind of house arrest and the eldest son still in detention.Although, a lot of money have been recovered from Mrs. Abacha since the death of her husband by the present government, there&#x27;s still huge sums of money in hard currencies that we have been able to move out of the country for safe keeping to the tune of US$50 million.This money US$50 Million is already in North American and if you are interested,we will prepare you as the beneficiary of the total funds,and you will share 25% of the total funds after clearance from the Security Company.Note, there is no risk involved in this project because l am involved as Abacha&#x27;s confidant.Please you should keep this transaction a top secret and we are prepared to do more business with you pending your approach towards this project.I await your urgent response.Thanks.

"credit support value for mg and paperco find below a spreadsheet with my very rough calculation of the value of credit support for mg and paperco . my approach is as follows : 1 . assume all contracts can be modelled as financial swaps . 2 . spread the notional trading volumes over the estimated swap tenors . 3 . calculate the value of defaulting at each period of the swap ( the default option ) using black &#x27; s formula . 4 . treat the value of the default options as risky cash flows . that is treat this value just like you would an annuity stream . by discounting back this stream of cash flows at the original risky rate and at the risk - reduced rate , i find the value of credit enhancement as the difference in the two npv &#x27; s . please give your comments , especially if this makes no sense to you . stinson",0
"http://www.quitpalestine.org./Funny as all hell.  So a group of 25 QUIT (Queers Undermining Israeli Terrorism) marched into the local starbucks in Berkeley (Of course, they pick a safe city like Berkeley, but hey, still funny) and &#x27;settle&#x27; driving away straights and other prior inhabitants with supersoakers :)Incredibly creative, in my opinion. Not terribly violent (I mean, how much damage can you -really-  do with a supersoaker?) but definintely a newscatcher.Its nice to see folks are finding some creative means to make a point.

I&#x27;m not sure why it is important that the first message in the sequence returned exists, but not necessarily any of the others, but I&#x27;m sure glad it is, as MhSeqExpand gets called lots, and I don&#x27;t know if I could cope if it were checking every file in the sequences it is looking at, all the time...It may help to keep a list of the valid message numbers for the current folder (though that would then need to be verified against changes to the directory).   Does tcl have a directory read function?   I assume so...Mh_Sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the context file) but I&#x27;m not sure how frequently that one is called.  | I&#x27;ll email anything I figure out since I&#x27;m leaving town in less    | than 48 hours.Have a good vacation.kre_______________________________________________ Exmh-workers mailing list Exmh-workers@redhat.com https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers",0

"proposal for a morphological database of classical greek i am writing to seek input on a proposal that we tentatively plan to submit to the neh at the end of the summer . the idea is fairly simple : we want to use the morphological parser that we have been developing for the past eight years or so to generate morphological analyses of every unique string in the thesaurus linguae graecae ( tlg ) , the database of greek texts available on cd rom from uc irvine . the tlg is large - - 42 million words at present and a new version is due out later this year with 57 million words . greek is a highly inflected language - - not as bad as georgian and some others , but a verb can , with prefixes , have millions of different forms . the tlg corpus extends over a thousand years and includes virtually all literary greek , and thus would support diachronic as well as synchronic linguistic analysis . i would like to know if there is anything we could do that would make this work on greek useful for the linguistics community in general ? classicists need this database , but it would be very exciting if it could stimulate additional work . the working summary of the project follows . the proposal outline is fairly succinct ( c . 7 pages ) but it is full of greek and does not lend itself readily to transliteration . if you would like to see a copy , please send me your us mail address and we will send one to you . casual reactions to just this summary are , however , more than welcome . note : reactions need not be positive . if this does not seem a worthwhile thing to pursue , i would love to know why . thanks ! gregory crane department of classics boylston 319 harvard university cambridge ma 02138 crane @ ikaros . harvard . edu a linguistic database of classical greek this project will extend an existing parser for classical greek , expanding its database of stems to cover the majority of all words attested in the literary record , and will use this database to create a morphologically parsed database of more than 1 , 000 , 000 unique strings available in the tlg : in the end , we will publish the database of analyzed strings , the databases of stems and endings which drive the parser and the parser itself . the resulting databases are an essential piece of scholarly infrastructure that will ( 1 ) revolutionize current searching techniques for the tlg and other greek databases , ( 2 ) make it possible to apply more sophisticated retrieval / text analysis to greek texts , and ( 3 ) provide a basic but crucial lookup tool that will aid non-specialists in other fields ( e . g . , philosophy , political science , religion ) who seek to work directly with the greek database . note : this document is a sketch for a possible proposal to be submitted to the neh at the end of august 1992 . it is , in effect , a proposal for a proposal and is thus open to revision on any and all points .",0

" I have a couple of small issues, and I&#x27;m not sure if their exmh issues or my setup issues.First, when I try and run exmh with wish from tk8.4.0 it seems to take forever to start, but with wish from tk8.a.4 it starts in a snap.Using the latest CVS, when I open exmh and the folder I&#x27;m in has unseen messages and I hit next, exmh changes to the next folder with unseen messages rather than to the first unseen in the current folder.Finally, when I reach the end of the messages in a folder and go on to the next unseen, exmh always goes back to inbox (which has no unseen messages) rather than the next folder with unseen messages.  (When I  goto next from inbox it does go where I would think it should go).Just wanted to let you know what I&#x27;m seeing and find out if I&#x27;m expecting some different than I should be.Thanks for all the effortJim _______________________________________________ Exmh-workers mailing list Exmh-workers@redhat.com https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers ",0

"Yo Mark,Have you goten the closed source drivers from Nvidia or are you still using the wans that came with Redbum? http://www.nvidia.com and then somewhere...somwhere-else...Installation is WELL detailed, you should see the NV splash screen, don;t forget to edit the config files.CW -------------------------------------- HiI have just installed Red Hat 7.2 on my desktop machine. I am completely new to Linux and therefore have run into a few problems.The graphic display on my PC doesnt seem to work. My monitor is slightly miss-aligned and I cannot run any high resolution games ( everything freezes ). In the hardware browser in Gnome it lists my Graphics Card (Riva TNT2), and shows installed drivers...... maybe the problem lies elswhere.Another problem I have is that I cannot install my ISDN, USB modem ( LASAT Speed Basic ), however im pretty sure its not supported by Linux, but again it is featured in the Hardware Browser, without installed drivers.If anybody has any ideas, please let me know cos id like to use Linux more. Please keep in mind I am new to it though.ThanksMark --  Irish Linux Users&#x27; Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

"URL: http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000637 Date: 2002-10-05T21:15:55-06:00I guess it&#x27;s time to reveal the incredibly kind invitation I received[1]. As  many of you may have found out or guessed, I will be attending oral argument  for the Eldred case[2] before the Supreme Court. I&#x27;m incredibly excited, as you might imagine. Visiting the Supreme Court would  be quite enough, but seeing such an important case...Dayenu! When Lessig asked  me if I was free that day to come, I laughed because I couldn&#x27;t (and still  can&#x27;t) think of anything I&#x27;d rather do than attend. I am eternally grateful to  Lessig for the chance to attend. On the other hand, I&#x27;m sort of embarassed to  have the opportunity, when there are surely others who deserve it far more than  me. Luckily, it seems that such deserving others will be able to get seats by  camping in line with us. So, I&#x27;ll be arriving in D.C. on Tuesday, attending an  Eldred/Duke/EPIC/Bookmobile superparty, and then camping in line with Seth  Schoen[3], Lisa Rein, Jace Cooke but unfortunately not Cory Doctorow. If you&#x27;d  like to come with us, let me know. I was hoping I&#x27;d be able to take notes and post them to my weblog for those who  couldn&#x27;t make it, but as I read in today&#x27;s Times, only lawyers and those with  official press credentials are allowed to take notes![4] I think this is  outrageous, but hopefully I will be able to remember enough to provide an  interesting account. In a related irony, today was &quot;Disney Day&quot; at Borders[5], where they played  Disney rock songs with the volume turned up too loud, disturbing my usual habit  of reading a book there. However, I did manage to skim through _The Practice of  Programming_. In an unrelated note, if you haven&#x27;t been electrocuted by a Model T spark plug,  I highly recommend it.[1] http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000609 [2] http://eldred.cc/ [3] http://vitanuova.loyalty.org/2002-10-02.html [4] http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/05/opinion/05AMAR.html [5] http://www.bordersstores.com/events/event_detail.jsp?SEID=15127444 ",0

Some people just don&#x27;t want to be confused by the facts. &gt;SUMMARY &gt; &gt;As part of an ongoing NASA/UAH joint project, Dr. John Christy of UAH &gt;and Dr. Roy Spencer of NASA&#x27;s Marshall Space Flight Center use data &gt;gathered by microwave sounding units (MSUs) on National Oceanic and &gt;Atmospheric Administration TIROS-N satellites to get accurate, direct &gt;measurements of atmospheric temperatures for almost all regions of the &gt;Earth [...]But some plonker will come up with yet another computer model predicting global warming and storms and floods in 50 years even though it can&#x27;t predict next week&#x27;s weather.  And predict widespread cooling in some parts of the globe (which is now part of global &quot;warming&quot;).  And will get plenty of publicity for even more conclusive scaremong^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H proof. &gt;[...] &gt;Globally, however, the satellite data show a cooling trend of 0.03 &gt;degrees Celsius per decade since the first NOAA TIROS-N satellites &gt;went into service.Umpteen studies have already shown that temperature variations, when even detectable in the noise, go either way depending on which data you look at. &gt;Of great concern to scientists is the lack of consistency in the way &gt;readings are taken [...] the construction of &gt;nearby roads, parking lots, runways and buildings may cause the &gt;temperature to rise a little due of urbanization. This temperature &gt;change may be an artifact of a local &quot;asphalt effect&quot; rather than a &gt;long-term widespread climate change.One study from Vienna showed long-term warming from thermometers at the airport, and none from other sites.  Another study with data from Antarctica which was touted as supporting global warming while being free from this urbanization effect later turned out to be dominated by the time of day at which the airplane that made the measurements flew (I may have mentioned this one b4...) &quot;There are no facts, only interpretations.&quot; - Friedrich Nietzsche. &quot;Bullshit!&quot; - Rob.     .-.                                                               .-.     /   \           .-.                                 .-.           /   \    /     \         /   \       .-.     _     .-.       /   \         /     \   /       \       /     \     /   \   / \   /   \     /     \       /       \  /         \     /       \   /     `-&#x27;   `-&#x27;     \   /       \     /         \             \   /         `-&#x27;                     `-&#x27;         \   /              `-&#x27;                                               `-&#x27; ",0

"Dear Sir,My name is Mr. Obi W, the manager, credit and foreign bills of Eco Bank Plc. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank with account number 14-255-2004/utb/t who perished in a plane crash [Korean Air Flight 801] with the whole passengers aboard on August 6, 1997.Since the demise of this our customer, I personally has watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds of usd.20.5 m, [twenty million five hundred thousand united states dollars] which has been with my branch for a very long time. On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the next of kin as no one has come up to be the next of kin. And the banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than five years, because money will be recalled to the bank treasury as unclaimed after this period. In view of this I got your contact through a trade journal after realizing that your name and country is similar to the deceased. I will give you 25% of the total.Upon the receipt of your response, I will send you by fax or e-mail the application, bank&#x27;s fax number and the next step to take. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within five banking days, after you apply to the bank as a relation to the deceased.When you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail signifying Your decision including your private Tel/Fax numbers for quick communication.Respectfully submitted,Obi   W. ",1

I think there&#x27;s been some confusion, so I recommend  &gt; the following: &gt;  &gt; 1. Use the CVS tag spamassassin_pre_2_4_0 which I just created  &gt; to generate your mass-checks &gt; 2. Submit the results via rsync in the usual way ASAP &gt; 3. Justin and I will cooperate on running the GA sometime around  &gt; midnight PST (GMT-0800) on thursday/friday &gt;  &gt; Any good data that&#x27;s in the rsync corpus by that time will be  &gt; used to feed the GA.  That will give everyone about 48 hours  &gt; from now to generate the logs and submit them, plus it&#x27;ll give  &gt; Justin and me about 48 hours to tinker with the GA (and  &gt; hopefully get it compiling again on my machine grumble  &gt; grumble).  That should then yield a 2.40 release sometime on  &gt; friday, possibly saturday if we need to do multiple GA runs to  &gt; tweak things properly. &gt;  &gt; C &gt;  &gt; PS Volunteering Justin here, since I suspect he&#x27;s probably fast  &gt; asleep right now.",0

Then again, maybe you&#x27;re right, it&#x27;s a very close match in job descriptions.  Obviously it does not concern anyone else, and since it&#x27;s none of my business, I&#x27;ll shut up about it and put it down to more funky fun in US politics.Afterall, all I know for certain about the Mormons is the background and fallout on my ex-wife&#x27;s excommunication ;)--  Gary Lawrence Murphy  TeleDynamics Communications Inc Business Innovations Through Open Source Systems: http://www.teledyn.com &quot;Computers are useless.

I&#x27;m new to this list, and new to Razor. Trying to get it to compile now (perhaps more on that later), but I&#x27;m wondering if it can really do what I need anyway. In short my question is whether Razor can process files directly from sendmail&#x27;s queues. Here&#x27;s the situation. &gt;You can use a milter with sendmail that will add an X-header labeling the mail as spam for procmail processing later (see smrazor: http://www.sapros.com/smrazor/ ). You can modify the .c file to reject the email instead.

Here is a  list of things I intend to re-read once the fog lifts: - _Phil Ringnalda_: Using FOAF relationships[1] and Just say no to Trackback in  index.html[2].  - _Les Orchard_: Per-post comment RSS feed[3].  - _Phil Wainewright_: The bare necessities of RSS[4] and What to do about RDF [5]. The beginning of an RSS 2.0 best practices document.  - _Jonathon Delacour_: Trying to score a goal[6]. â€œAs the best and the  brightest focus on the possibilities of FOAF, I turned my attention to  yesterday&#x27;s news: RSS.â€ No, RSS will always be today&#x27;s news. Get it?  Today&#x27;s newzzz... Never mind.  - Comments on Ben Hammersley&#x27;s Friend of a Friend[7]. Various ways to link to a  FOAF file from an RSS feed.  - _Nicholas Chase_: The Web&#x27;s future: XHTML 2.0[8]. We&#x27;re losing backward  compatibility, isn&#x27;t that great? Well, he seems to think so.  - mod_cc[9], a module for including copyright information in RDF documents such  as RSS 1.0 feeds, and, I hope, FOAF files.  - _Shelley Powers_: Who is your audience, and what are you trying to  accomplish?[10] Addressing the growing identity crisis on the RSS-DEV mailing  list[11].

"query : chinese grammatical markers i &#x27; m interested in any information regarding the diachronic development of the following grammatical markers in various chinese languages ( apologies for the email-mutilated transcriptions ) : ( 1 ) mandarin : [ de ] ( the &quot; genitive &quot; / &quot; relative &quot; marker ) ( 2 ) mandarin : [ ge ] ( the general numeral classifier ) ( 3 ) shanghainese : [ ge ] ( the &quot; genitive &quot; / &quot; relative &quot; marker ) ( 4 ) hokkien : [ e ] ( a ) ( the &quot; genitive &quot; / &quot; relative &quot; marker ) ( b ) ( the general numeral classifier ) ( 5 ) teochew : [ kai ] ( a ) ( the &quot; genitive &quot; / &quot; relative &quot; marker ) ( b ) ( the general numeral classifier ) ( 6 ) cantonese : [ ge ] ( the &quot; genitive &quot; / &quot; relative &quot; marker ) [ go ] ( the general numeral classifier ) [ dik ] ( the ligature ) more specifically : question 1 : which of the above markers are historically / etymologically related to which others , ie . deriving from a diachronically reconstructable common source ? ( eg . are mandarin [ de ] and cantonese [ dik ] diachronically related ? , etc . etc . ) question 2 : ( specific to hokkien and teochew ) most native speakers of hokkien and teochew , who are also speakers of mandarin , are of the opinion that there are two distinct markers exhibiting accidental homophony : a &quot; genitive &quot; / &quot; relative &quot; [ e ] / [ kai ] corresponding to mandarin [ de ] , and a &quot; classifier &quot; [ e ] / [ kai ] corresponding to mandarin [ ge ] . question 2a : is it demonstrably the case that [ e ] and [ kai ] are the respective products of diachronic coalescence of distinct forms at some earlier stage of the language ? question 2b : are there any valid synchronic arguments for positing two distinct lexical items , ie . two [ e ] &#x27;s in hokkien , and two [ kai ] &#x27;s in teochew ? ( i consider the choice of characters conventionally used to represent these markers as irrelevant . ) note : i am a general linguist , not a sinologist , and i do n&#x27;t read or speak chinese . i would greatly appreciate either your own views on the above questions , or references to published works addressing these questions . however , if the references happen to be in chinese , i would be extremely grateful if you could provide a synopsis of their contents . thanks , david gil national university of singapore ellgild @ nusvm . bitnet",0

"sum : mongolian - g - some weeks ago i posted a query as to the historical source of an epenthetic / g / , which appears between certain stem-final and suffix-initial vowels in mongolian . only sergej krylov knew about mongolian specifically , and his message appears below . &gt; some remarks about the epenthetic / g / in mongolian . &gt; as far as i know : &gt; 1 ) in &quot; hard &quot; words it is not phonetically / g / , it is a &gt; fricative sound ( written phonetically as the greek &quot; gamma &quot; ) . &gt; in &quot; soft &quot; words it is / g / . ( note that the traditional terms for &gt; &quot; hard &quot; and &quot; soft &quot; words are &quot; back &quot; and &quot; front &quot; recpectively , &gt; but at least for khalkha the terms &quot; hard &quot; and &quot; soft &quot; are &gt; preferable ) . &gt; 2 ) historically it was not an epenthesis . on the contrary , in &gt; proto - mongolian there was no long vowels , and between the &gt; short vowels corresponding the modern mongolian &quot; morae &quot; &gt; ( halves of the long syllables ) there was &quot; g &quot; . the old mongolian &gt; script shows it rather clearly . then this &quot; g &quot; became &gt; &quot; weakened &quot; between vowels , and then it was fully omitted , &gt; and instead of two syllables appeared two-morae ( that is , &gt; long ) syllables . &gt; but there were some phonological positions where there &gt; were no elision of &quot; g &quot; , namely , where two sequences of the &gt; type v + g + v followed after each other . that is : vgv - - ) vv - - &gt; long v ; but vgv + vgv - - ) vvgvv - - &gt; long v + g + long v ( it was before &gt; suffixes with initial vgv ) ( unfortunately i do n&#x27;t know how to &gt; represent &quot; gamma &quot; and the transcriptional symbol of length in ) this e-mail system and have to write &quot; g &quot; and &quot; long &quot; ) . &gt; as a result of this process , the modern mongolian &gt; epenthesis appeared . &gt; the direction of the diachronic sound changes do not &gt; necessarily coincide with the direction of the sound &gt; alternation viewed from the purely synchronic point of view . &gt; the example with the mongolian epenthesis is one of the &gt; examples for it . &gt; if my remarks are not clear enough , i can explain it &gt; separately . &gt; sincerely yours , &gt; sergej a . krylov &gt; ursula doleschal ( ursula . doleschal @ wu-wien . ac . at ) &gt; institut f . slawische sprachen , wirtschaftsuniv . wien &gt; augasse 9 , 1090 wien , austria &gt; tel . : + + 43 - 1-31336 4115 , fax : + + 43 - 1-31336 744",0

"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2541827.stmWednesday, 4 December, 2002, 08:52 GMT Bomber targets Dutch Ikea storesPolice in the Netherlands are searching all 10 outlets of the Ikea furniture chain in the country, after finding bombs in two stores. The devices were discovered in Amsterdam and Sliedrecht, near the port city of Rotterdam on Tuesday evening. The Sliedrecht bomb exploded at a police station, injuring two policeman. Police have also closed off a motorway section in the central city Utrecht, near a third IKEA store where a suspicious package was found. No information about the motive behind the attacks has been released. &quot;We decided together with the police because of safety reasons that the company&#x27;s stores in the Netherlands would be closed today,&quot; said Ikea spokeswoman Helen van Trearum. &quot;We don&#x27;t want to take any risks. We are taking this very seriously,&quot; she added. Ikea - a Swedish-based group - is one of the world&#x27;s largest furniture retailers, with stores in more than 30 countries.

"what the manual said - a diversity antenna.Why wouldn&#x27;t it work well with one omni and one directional antena?

People drove for hours just to taste      our Twinkie,&quot; said Rocky Mullen, who sells the deep-fried, cream-filled      treats for $3 (U.S.) each at the Payallup Fair, 50 kilometres south of      Seattle.     As if Twinkies are not sweet enough already, vendors such as Mr. Mullen add      chocolate or berry sauce and sprinkle powdered sugar on top...     Hearing about Mr. Sell&#x27;s invention, Hostess, the company that makes the      71-year-old snack, started promoting deep-fried Twinkies to state and      county fairs, where a captive population of junk-food addicts began      gobbling them up between pig races and tractor-pull competitions.     How bad are they for your health? After deep-frying, a Twinkie packs an      estimated 400 calories and 28 grams of fat.

"update - reimbursement of individually billed items the use of cell phones and pagers has increased dramatically in the past few years . as a result the accounts payable department has seen a rapid increase in the number of invoices and vendors . with the higher volume , we have reviewed our processes in order to continue our rapid payment cycle . although we encourage vendors to address their invoices to individual employees , they often mail invoices directly to accounts payable . at times they fail to list the individual who uses the pager or cell phone . in these cases we return the invoice to the vendor . if the employee is designated , we try to track him / her down and forward the invoice . the high level of employee movement among jobs and locations at enron has made this increasingly challenging . either way , we end up doing something less productive than paying invoices . to maintain satisfactory response to our vendors and to reduce time necessary for research , we request that employees who have pagers , cell phones , and other individually billed items such as licenses , subscriptions , etc . , pay for them by personal check or charge card ( if applicable  * payment instructions are usually indicated on the invoice ) and request reimbursement through employee expense reports . by submitting these charges on your expense report , you can help us reduce the amount of time spent researching and forwarding invoices , the number of checks generated by treasury , the number of vendors in our database , and the turnaround time for payment of invoices . incidentally , accounts payable is currently installing a corporate - wide web - based expense reporting system similar to what enron international has used for the past year . this will make it even easier to file your expense report and receive quick reimbursement . we  , d like to make this effective immediately . if you have any questions or suggestions , please contact the accounts payable department .",0

"grammatical relations for some time , i have been puzzled by a claim that i come across frequently in the formal grammatical literature , namely that since grammatical relations are derived , therefore they cannot be referred to by the grammar . please note that my puzzlement is not concerned with whether grammatical relations are primitive or derived , nor with whether or not the grammar can refer to grammatical relations , but rather with the alleged causal relation between answers to these two questions . more specifically , my puzzlement is not concerned with why some people believe both that grammatical relations are derived and that grammatical relations cannot be referred to by the grammar , but rather with why they think the second belief follows necessarily from the first . to take what seems to be a parallel instance , valid at least for many versions of formal grammar : control ( c-control , etc . ) is a derived concept , but can be referred to by the grammar - - so the causal link between derived status and inaccessibility to the grammar seems to be denied in other areas . i would be grateful for any enlightenment on this issue . sender : bernard comrie department of linguistics gfs-301 university of southern california los angeles , ca 90089-1693 , usa . tel . + 1 213 740 2986 . fax + 1 213 740 9306 . e - mail comrie @ bcf . usc . edu",0

"jm@jmason.org (Justin Mason) writes:&gt; Folks who&#x27;ve been hacking on the DNSBLs: would it be worthwhile commenting &gt; this in HEAD, seeing as it only gets .77 anyway? &gt;  &gt; Sounds like the (a) broken server and (b) low hitrate combine to make it &gt; not-so-useful IMO.No, in my opinion, it&#x27;s purely a bug in SA (or the libraries we use, which is the same thing) that we don&#x27;t handle outages of network services better.The rule is useful and it does help reduce spam, we should keep it.  I have a feeling the DNSBL rules will cluster a bit more heavily around the 1.0 to 2.0 range once we start using the new GA on them.Also, 0.77 was a slightly conservative number.  Since I didn&#x27;t have real-time data, I typically used the lower or median number of different periods (most recent month, two months, six months), depending on the trend of the period data (better performance for recent messages -&gt; favor recent scores, worse performance for recent messages -&gt; favor lowest scores, never pick the highest number unless the rule was very accurate and the highest number was for the most recent data).Dan ",0

"machine usable dictionary as you may know from postings i have made to this list over the last couple of months , derek bickerton and i are developing a parser based on a theory of syntax that he and i have been developing over the last four years . we are about to purchase a machine usable dictionary with approximately 70 , 000 entries for $ 2500 . if anyone could advise us whether or not that is our best bet , or where we might find other dictionaries , we would appreciate hearing from you . we are currently working with a dictionary of under 1000 words , so it is imperative that we obtain a larger one , so we may begin working with larger corpora . toward that end we would also like to find out which texts were used in past parsing competitions and where the results of these competitions are published . we believe that with a few weeks of work we should be able to modify a dictionary sufficiently to allow us to begin experinmenting with texts that were used in past parsing competitions . here are the specs the parser . it is based on a series of algorithms that have been four years in the making , but the programming required to create this parser has only taken 300 hours using c + + . there areapproximately 3000 lines of code that take up 150k executable on disk . about 100k of ram is required to run the parser . 30k on disk is required for a 300 word dictionary . an average sentence takes under 4 seconds to process on a 486 ibm compatible . since this is only a development version , we expect these numbers to change . to date , no optimizations have occurred , and we expect to significantly shrink the dictionary disk usage and the execution time . phil bralich bralich @ uhccux . uhcc . hawaii . edu",0

You&#x27;ll end up with a boot loader on the backup disk that contains the &#x27;physical&#x27; location of the /boot/map file on the main disk.  That won&#x27;t necessarily be the same as the backup disk.I can&#x27;t think of a right way to do his with LILO.  I&#x27;ve got a similar seup on my home machine (rsync to a backup disk every night), but I&#x27;ll be pulling out the RH install CDs to get LILO sorted if I have to do a disk swap.GRUB should be able to handle this no problem, since it doesn&#x27;t record sector numbers like LILO does.

"In 1957, a monastery in Thailand was being relocated and a group of monks was put in charge of moving a giant clay Buddha. In the midst of the move one of the monks noticed a crack in the Buddha. Concerned about damaging the idol, the monks decided to wait for a day before continuing with their task. When night came, one of the monks came to check on the giant statue. He shined his flashlight over the entire Buddha. When he reached the crack he saw something reflected back at him. The monk, his curiosity aroused, got a hammer and a chisel and began chipping away at the clay Buddha. As he knocked off piece after piece of clay, the Buddha got brighter and brighter. After hours of work, the monk looked up in amazement to see standing before him a huge solid-gold Buddha.Many historians believe the Buddha had been covered with clay by Thai monks several hundred years earlier before an attack by the Burmese army. They covered the Buddha to keep it from being stolen. In the attack all the monks were killed, so it wasn&#x27;t until 1957, when the monks were moving the giant statue, that the great treasure was discovered. Like the Buddha, our outer shell protects us from the word: our real treasure is hidden within. We human beings unconsciously hide our inner gold under a layer of clay. All we need to do to uncover our gold is to have the courage to chip away at our outer shell, piece by piece.Could you be sitting on your own gold mine? Did you know the average American can retire a millionaire on his or her current income? Then, why don&#x27;t they? It&#x27;s simple. They haven&#x27;t been taught that they could. They are taught to use debt to get what they want now instead of having their money work for them. They pay too much in taxes. They are wasting money every month and don&#x27;t even realize it. In short, they are financially unhealthy.

[use VMWare&#x27;s ability to rolll back state to recover from intrusions] &gt;&gt; &gt; I did my dissertation work in this area (Optimistic Computing &gt; ) and so was &gt; interested in applying it to the security problem. Unfortunately, &gt; you hit a bunch of problems: &gt; &gt; * When can you &quot;commit&quot; a state as being &quot;good&quot;? You can&#x27;t &gt; run from a redo log forever; the performance and storage &gt; penalties accumulate. Even log structured file systems &gt; garbage collect eventually. So you have to commit sometime. &gt; The problem is that if you commit too eagerly, you might &gt; commit corrupted state. If you commit too conservatively, &gt; you eat performance and storage penalties. &gt; * What do you do if you discover that there is corrupted state &gt; in the *middle* of your redo log, and you want some of the &gt; critical state that comes after it? You need some way to dig &gt; the corruption out of the middle and save the rest. My &gt; dissertation solves this problem, but you have to re-write &gt; everything in my programming language :) &gt; * Just doing this at all imposes substantial performance &gt; penalties. I love VMWare, and use it every day (the best &gt; $200 I ever spent on software) but it is not very fast. &gt; &gt; My proposed solution to the first two problems you mention is to be &gt; less ambitious. The idea is that you *never* commit - instead, you &gt; simply revert to base state on reboot.Ah. In that case, you can use something considerably less powerful than VMWare. All you need is a machine configured to boot from CD-ROM and use a RAM disk for scratch space. Numerous Linux distros are available that let you boot a stateless but functional system from CD-ROM.&gt; Obviously, you can&#x27;t do this with partitions that accrue important &gt; state, e.g. a partition that stores database table data.... but if you *do* want some state to persist, then you need a mountable writable partition. To protect it, you need some kind of access control management to decide who can do what to the writable partition, blah blah blah ... and before you know it, the security problem starts to look just like it does for conventional servers.Simple approxmation to this: make /usr a separate partion, and mount it read-only: * The good news: attackers that want to trojan your software have to reboot, at least. * The bad news: administrators that want to update your software have to reboot, at least.Crispin-- Crispin Cowan, Ph.D. Chief Scientist, WireX http://wirex.com/~crispin/ Security Hardened Linux Distribution: http://immunix.org Available for purchase: http://wirex.com/Products/Immunix/purchase.html",0

"glibc and binutils, which the lfs site says not to optimise, already determines what system you&#x27;re compiling on, and optimises itself to that. That&#x27;s my understanding of how it works anyway.JohnSubject: Re: [ILUG] Optimizing for Pentium Pt.2 On Fri, Jul 26, 2002 at 11:24:30PM +0100, John Gay wrote: &gt; A while ago I asked what other packages I should optomize for Pentium.&gt; One &gt; person answered GlibC. This got me thinking about GCC itself, so I asked on &gt; another list and got a few answers, most were &quot;don&#x27;t even think about it&quot; but &gt; a few suggested GCC and one pointed me to Linux From Scratch.why?or more specifically, what do you mean? on one hand you can optimise how gcc is compiled. all that will do is make it generate the exact same code just a smidge faster. and since gcc is such a memory pig, you&#x27;d do better to buy more ram to up your fs cache hits and to keep gcc&#x27;s heap out of swap.on the other side you can look into patches to gcc that affect it&#x27;s code generation. um, ok, but keep in mind that compiler errors suck. i can&#x27;t express that enough. compilers should just work. perfectly. always. doing anything that might affect that is, in my opinion, insane. they&#x27;re hard to trace and you&#x27;d better have a deep knowledge of what&#x27;s going on to either report bugs to the patch developers or to fix it yourself. plus my understanding is that gcc would need major changes to get large speed boosts on x86 chips.kevin -- Irish Linux Users&#x27; Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

It does not.   &gt;  &gt; All I want is the OS and GNU apps. I was under &gt; the impression that for *_those_* all one &gt; needed was to pay for the media and not for the &gt; code itself? &gt;  &gt; Ai-je tort? &gt;  &gt;  &gt; &gt; It provides that _if_ you&#x27;ve lawfully received &gt; &gt; a copy of the covered binary version, you have &gt; &gt; rights to also receive the matching source code. &gt;  &gt; My understanding was that binaries or whatever &gt; could be received for the cost of the media plus &gt; a token of one&#x27;s appreciation (the latter being &gt; subject to agreement between the parties) - I was &gt; offering a bottle of wine plus maybe a pint or two &gt; and a chat for a copy - I don&#x27;t know what the going &gt; rate is.The GPL makes no stipulations about charging for binaries. In fact, you can go get the sources for, say, GNU&#x27;s /bin/true, compile it yourself and try selling the resulting binary for EUR 1000.  (And, with a good enough sales pitch, you just might get away with it!)However, what the GPL does stipulate is that you must  provide the sources for that binary if asked.  So I might buy it from you for EUR 1000, compile it myself and sell that binary for EUR 1.  Of course, I&#x27;ll need to provide the sources to anyone that asks as well.  But, I just might make money at this, since there might be a market of 10000 people who would pay 1 euro for the convenience of getting a binary.But then, John Looney would step in, buy it from me for 1 euro, burn it and the sources and some of his favourite /bin/true patches on a CD and duplicate it for the cost of the media or a cream bun, depending on how hungry he is.You see, the GPL doesn&#x27;t force the binaries to be zero-cost (or cost-of-media), but it puts a really big hole in any business plan that solely resells GPL software.  You _can_ charge for it if you want, but you bloody well better be providing some value for that money, or you&#x27;ll go out of business faster than a dot-com in 2001.And there are real ways to provide this value for money (convenience of getting it on one CD, convenience of a friendly installer, convenience of vendor-supplied updates, convenience of having what lots of other people have, posting a CD and paying a few euro is cheaper than downloading over a modem, warm fuzzy feeling of getting something from a &quot;real&quot; company, etc).There will be segments of the market that will pay various amounts for GPL software and there will be others that don&#x27;t. Thankfully, the GPL allows for both, _by_design_.  But the source will always be free (or minimal cost).Later, Kenn --  Irish Linux Users&#x27; Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

"semantics ; a network theory of reference , kiyoshi ishikawa a network theory of reference kiyoshi ishikawa ( hosei university ) noting specific inadequacies with truth-conditional approaches , ishikawa develops a dynamic theory of reference incorporating features of discourse representation theory , file change semantics and situation semantics , and also deals with non-monotonic belief revision . he argues that the task of natural language semantics is to describe meaning in terms of the psychological relation of language to our cognition of external reality . in his approach , a linguistic expression &#x27;s meaning is its potential to change the information state of a cognitive agent . reference is not understood as a link to a real individual external to an agent , but as the agent &#x27;s act to link a character in a linguistic frame of individuation to characters in other ( linguistic or nonlinguistic ) frames . as the target of inquiry , the distinction between referential and attributive uses of definite descriptions is analyzed through the construction of conversation scenarios . in addition , ishikawa extends his theory to an analysis of belief and attitude reports . application of the theory to cleft and pseudocleft constructions is also outlined . presented in a very accessible style , ishikawa &#x27;s theory will be of interest to scholars in cognitive science / artificial intelligence and philosophy as well as linguistics .

It incorporates  many suggestions from Dive Into Accessibility[1], a book which was written in  and is still powered by Movable Type. I find this amusing in a self-referential  sort of way. The other big change is the inclusion of MT-search to allow users to have their  own site search. Every web site needs a site search[2]. Existing MT-search  users should merge the contents of mt-search.cfg into mt.cfg, change  &quot;TemplateDir&quot; to &quot;SearchTemplatePath&quot;, and (if you use alternate templates)  change &quot;AltTemplate1&quot;, &quot;AltTemplate2&quot;, &quot;AltTemplate3&quot;, etc. to &quot;AltTemplate&quot;.

Rent control would be an &gt; example of a regulation solution that is in general worse than spending &gt; tons of money on public housing. &gt; &gt; As for the definition of a liberal being someone who seeks to impose &gt; both, I find no fault in that definition whatsoever. The opinion that &gt; EITHER we are spending too much OR we have too much regulation is pretty &gt; much anathema to liberal politics. &gt; &gt; Finally, those who argue that there are private replacements for much &gt; government regulation are not saying that a state of nature (no private &gt; replacements, no government regulation) is better than government &gt; regulation itself. &gt; &gt; And in my experience people who label themselves &#x27;Green&#x27; (which does not &gt; include everyone who loves trees and thinks smokestacks are ugly) is a &gt; watermelon. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -----Original Message----- &gt; &gt; From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of &gt; Geege &gt; &gt; Schuman &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; funny. i read it as green = red, as in accounting, as in fiscally &gt; &gt; irresponsible. which do you think is the worse indictment - &gt; &gt; overregulation &gt; &gt; or overspending? there are many (dickheads) who buy into the &gt; &gt; neo-conservative media&#x27;s (fox&#x27;s) definiton of &quot;liberal&quot; as &quot;one who &gt; seeks &gt; &gt; to &gt; &gt; impose both.&quot; &gt; &gt; &gt;",0

"&gt; If the text recognition algorithm/architecture humans use is anything &gt; like the algorithm/structure we&#x27;ve been working with, the reason the &gt; first letter (and to a lesser extent, the last letter) is important is &gt; that without it the text pattern recognition problem is exponentially &gt; more difficult (from a theoretical standpoint anyway) and has to be &gt; resolved using deeper abstraction analysis.  The middle letters are far &gt; less important and computationally much easier to resolve correctly.I think keeping the number of middle letters consistent with the correct spelling is important.  Would be interesting to see if this same effect is applicable to written forms of other languages, maybe even Japanese romongi.Bill ",0

"Rohit forwards from the NYT: &gt; Bigger Bar Code Inches Up on Retailers &gt; August 12, 2002 &gt; By KATE MURPHY I can&#x27;t imagine why they&#x27;re inching forward through  13- and then 14- digit extensions; seems they should just leap ahead to something with real headroom, say 40-digit numbers (128 bits or more). How hard can it be to widen the glyph area and  narrow the bars? The sensors have got to be tens or even hundreds of times more accurate/robust  than when barcodes first took off.One segment of the article along these lines:&gt; But moving to 13 digits may not be enough. The Universal &gt; Code Council and EAN International, which formed an &gt; alliance in 1996, strongly advise manufacturers and &gt; retailers to go a step further and prepare their systems to &gt; accommodate a 14-digit code. That is the length of a newly &gt; patented bar code that takes up less space. Its reduced &gt; size means that it can be affixed to small items like loose &gt; produce, and the extra digits let a retailer keep track of &gt; additional data like batch and lot numbers.

"great fun trying to find a dumb ADSL modem with Ethernet presentation, everybody wants to sell routers but I intend on doing pppoe from another device, something with more than one Ethernet port would be nice. anybody got any recommendations ?Uly----- Original Message ----- From: To: Cc: Sent: Monday, October 07, 2002 10:35 AM Subject: Re: [ILUG] adsl router modem combo &gt; It seems to only support PPPoA and not PPPoE. You need one that supports &gt; PPPoE, if you want torun it in routed IP mode. If you are using it as a &gt; bridge, it&#x27;ll probably work, but you&#x27;d be left leaving the computer on, &gt; which would defeat the purpose of getting a router. &gt; &gt; The best router I&#x27;ve come accross is the Zyxel 643.

"&gt; That always amazes me about &#x27;regular&#x27; dreams - how often they come true. &gt; In 1993 or so, when I was a student in Edinburgh, I had a bad dream about being chased around a house by a scary murderous tramp who was carrying a bag full of half-penny coins (which had long since ceased to be legal tender). The next morning as I left the flat, I found a half-penny on the doormat right outside our door. Fair gave me the willies, that did.TimC------------------------ Yahoo!

"query : writing and phonology are there many languages with contrastive vowel length which dont represent vowel length in the writing system ? this does happen when someone with a poor understanding of the language devises a writing system for it from outside , or when a vowel length language adopts a writing system from a non-vowel - length language , but i would be interested to hear of cases of indigenous writing systems that ignore such an important aspect of phonology . the reason for my interest is korean . it is often said to have contrastive vowel length , at least in certain word-pairs , and yet it does not show it in the script . the fact it doesnt - coupled with the fact that native speakers have difficulty picking which word has the long vowel - seems to me like an argument for treating the distinction as one of accent or stress rather than vowel length . but the argument depends on how common it is for writing systems to ignore vowel length . what do people think ? reply to me and i &#x27; ll make a summary of responses if there are several . thanks helen _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ hfraser @ metz . une . edu . au ( 129 . 180 . 4 . 1 ) helen fraser ( dr ) dept of linguistics university of new england armidale nsw 2351 australia phone 067 73 2128 / 3189 fax 067 73 3735",0

" Remember when I said that taking an afternoon off to march for Dmitri was pissing in the wind and that to be really effective we needed people willing to publically break the stupid laws right in the face of the authorities?Well it seems Bruce Perens agrees with me, only he&#x27;s going one better, instead of just mouthing off about it, he&#x27;s going to do it and do it  in a big way ...     Open source campaigner to risk jail     By James Middleton [24-07-2002]    Bruce Perens plans live DVD hack    With the dust from the Elcomsoft/Sklyarov case still thick in the     air, influential open source activist Bruce Perens plans to go one     better by breaking the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DCMA)     during a live presentation on Friday.    Fresh from giving RealNetworks a slating for not completely     backing open source with its latest announcement, Perens said that     during a Digital Rights Management presentation to be held Friday     at the O&#x27;Reilly developer conference in San Diego, he would break     the law.    The DMCA has been a sore point in the open source community since     the outlawing of DeCSS, a tool created so that DVDs could be     played on Linux machines, and more recently since the arrest of     Dmitry Sklyarov and the criminal charges faced by his employer,     Elcomsoft.    Based on the recent history of DMCA contravention, Perens could     face imprisonment or a $500,000 fine for his actions.    According to Infoworld the demonstration is to be carried out in     protest at the regional system used by the motion picture industry     to prevent DVDs released in one country being played on machines     in another country.    During his presentation, Perens will demonstrate how to hack a DVD     player so that it can play movies from any region.    &quot;It is a political and social statement, and the statement is that     the people do not need to have a hall monitor living in their     stereo system and should be able to play any kind of media on the     device they wish,&quot; he was quoted as saying.    But luck may be on his side, if last year is anything to go by. At     the same conference in 2001 Perens made a presentation on the     triviality of Digital Rights Management systems using exactly the     same slides that got Sklyarov arrested.http://www.vnunet.com/News/1133862--  Gary Lawrence Murphy  TeleDynamics Communications Inc Business Innovations Through Open Source Systems: http://www.teledyn.com &quot;Computers are useless.

"workshop annoncement and call for papers - clitics workshop announcement and call for papers c l i t i c s 24th - 26th february 1999 konstanz university , germany we are pleased to announce our workshop on &#x27; clitics &#x27; during the 21st annual meeting of the german society of linguistics in konstanz ( germany ) . in linguistic research , clitics play an increasingly prominent role . the status of clitics is under discussion in phonology , morphology , and syntax , as well as in the respective interfaces . in these fields , the discussion on clitics gives rise to controversial analyses . one open question is whether we need in fact a separate linguistic category &#x27; clitic &#x27; , or whether these elements can be subsumed under different linguistic categories , such as affixes . - with respect to phonology , it is undetermined how clitics are incorporated into phonological structure . should we distinguish a clitic group in the prosodic hierarchy , are clitics part of prosodic words , or are they left outside prosodic structure ? how is their phonological deficiency best accounted for ? - concerning the morphology of clitics , especially regarding the occurrence of opaque clitics in clitic clusters , analyses within the framework of distributed morphology compete with those which propose an optimality theoretic solution . - also , the morphosyntactic status of clitics is unclear . is it possible to capture the order of clitics in clitic clusters in a more explanatory way than in terms of templates ? the complex conditions on clitic doubling give rise to the question whether clitics should be analysed as agreement markers or as arguments . - syntactic aspects of clitics play a major role in recent analyses in different theoretical frameworks . for instance , there is no agreement on the explanation of clitic climbing and it is an unsettled issue whether clitic placement should be accounted for in a syntactic , prosodic , prosodic-syntactic , or optimality-theoretic approach . the workshop intends to bring together phonologists , morphologists , and syntacticians and provides an ideal opportunity to share insights and to discuss the issues mentioned above . in addition to the invited speaker presentations , there are 9 slots for 30 - minute presentations , and 3 slots for 1 hour presentations ( including discussion ) . invited speakers : geert booij ( free university amsterdam ) jane grimshaw ( rutgers university ) juan uriagereka ( university of maryland ) please send a one-page abstract before 15th august 1998 to : birgit gerlach &amp; janet grijzenhout , seminar fuer allgemeine sprachwissenschaft , heinrich - heine - universitaet , universitaetsstr . 1 , 40225 duesseldorf , germany . we may be contacted by e-mail at gerlach @ phil-fak . uni-duesseldorf . de , or grijzenh @ phil-fak . uni-duesseldorf . de",0

"Paul Jakma&#x27;s [paul@clubi.ie] 67 lines of wisdom included: &gt; i thought the firewalling code on all the BSDs was fairly related - &gt; sorry. So FreeBSD&#x27;s ipfw is not encumbered in the same way the old &gt; OBSD firewalling was?Nope, indeed IPFW2 has just been rolled out into -STABLE. (-STABLE is a stable branch of the code that has been rolled into -CURRENT first. It&#x27;s basically a major release, that&#x27;s still a work in progress)&gt; to an extent, i guess so, yes. but i&#x27;ve a few boxes with reasonable  &gt; uptimes that run netfilter/iptables. (i&#x27;ve one that has crashed twice  &gt; now after 60+ day uptimes. but that doesnt seem to be netfilter). &gt;  &gt; course, there&#x27;s a lot more that can go wrong with a firewall than the &gt; firewall code. in that case get 2 boxes and heartbeat them.I don&#x27;t really judge things by uptimes, it&#x27;s rather like judging penis size. People like comparing them, and the larger they are, the more people are in awe of them, but overly large ones aren&#x27;t really practical!&gt; indeed. couldnt agree more. &gt;  &gt; (that&#x27;s the nice thing about *nix - fact we /can/ have nit-picking  &gt; arguments about which *nix and firewall code is better).Defiantely. I wouldn&#x27;t like anyone to accuse me of being a nit-picker though ;)&gt; i&#x27;ve no experience of ipfw. (closest i&#x27;ve come is looking at IPFilter  &gt; for IRIX - but it had a problem in that it wasnt maintained  &gt; anymore. however, while the englishy syntax is nice, i dont think  &gt; iptables command  syntax is a big obstacle). &gt;  &gt; anyway.. there&#x27;s choice. and as i understand it, with the advent of  &gt; netfilter/iptables there&#x27;s now almost nothing between them from a  &gt; technical POV. (apart from ipfw being in use a lot longer).Well, as someone who&#x27;s used ipchains quite heavily about two years ago, I can guarantee you that the learning curve for reading ipchains rules and ipfw rules is quite different. Of course once you&#x27;ve memorised (not necessarily sitting down with a sheet of them and learning them off by rote) them, you wonder what all the fuss is about before.It&#x27;s not in itself a reason to choose one firewall product over another, but if that&#x27;s all there is in the difference, and the learning curve for the Operating System is the same, then I know what I&#x27;d prefer, as a beginner.This is all getting rather off-topic now anyways, but since I&#x27;ve been doing quite a lot of work with ipfw over the last week I jumped on the bandwagon.--    Philip Reynolds            RFC Networks          tel: 01 8832063 www.rfc-networks.ie      fax: 01 8832041--  Irish Linux Users&#x27; Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

"There seem to be two &quot;drivers&quot; for the classifier now: Neale Pickett&#x27;s hammie.py, and the original GBayes.py.  According to the README.txt, GBayes.py hasn&#x27;t been kept up to date.  Is there anything in there that isn&#x27;t covered by hammie.py?  About the only useful feature of GBayes.py that hammie.py doesn&#x27;t (yet) copy is -u, which calculates spamness for an entire mailbox.  This feature can easily be copied into hammie.py.  (GBayes.py also has a large collection of tokenizers; but timtoken.py rules, so I&#x27;m not sure how interesting that is now.)Therefore I propose to nuke GBayes.py, after adding a -u feature.Anyone against?

It seems some of those meanings have evolved a bit, too.In particular, there was a claim that the commandment on stealing was actually specifically about &#x27;man stealing -- selling a free man into slavery.  Certainly the US southerners were particularly sensitive to the term &#x27;man stealer&#x27; in a way I didn&#x27;t understand.Yep, I know he said all holy books.

I&#x27;ve made a lot of friends in the MS complaints department, its amazing what you can say to them and get away with it --::)))CWAnd no sorry I don&#x27;t know the solution, they must be pretty bad quality though if you can fit 25 albums on one CD. I would say they are Mpeg encoded or some buzz like that. --------------------- I&#x27;ve got some really interesting wav files here.A friend had a Windows CD with, wait for it . . .Every Beatles Record ever released in the U.K.! Including the Christmas and  BBC special albums! All on one, ordinary CD! Yes a 650M CD!Of course this CD also had a special Windows app for playing this collection!I had a look at the contents of the CD, since I don&#x27;t do Windows, and the  albums appeared to be plain wav files? Each album in it&#x27;s own wav file, 25  Albums, 25 wav files?!? I copied the wav files to my hard drive. Curious thing, though, noatun crashes on some of the larger ones, seems to  attempt to load the entire file into memory first, and on the ones it doesn&#x27;t  crash on, it plays them fast and noisily? kwave refuses to recognise them  completely and wavp just makes an ungodly noise!xanim can, and does play them correctly though. Unfortunately xanim does nothave any position control so you just have to listen to the album from startto finish.file has this to say about them:johngay@debian:/home/jgay$ file beatles/SGT.WAV beatles/SGT.WAV: RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio, Microsoft ADPCM,  stereo 22050 Hz johngay@debian:/home/jgay$ ls -l beatles/SGT.WAV -r-xr-xr-x    1 johngay  johngay  53334900 Sep 27  2001 beatles/SGT.WAVAnd this is SGT Pepper&#x27;s lonely Hearts Club Band album. 51M is quite good,  considering it also has the inner track. But they certainly are NOT in stereo.What I would like to do is split up the tracks and convert them the mp3 for  xmms. I&#x27;m jsut not sure what tools would be able to handle these strange  compressed wav&#x27;s that only xanim seems to recognise? I like the albums, but  would prefer to be able to sellect tracks to play rather than entire albums  and be able to listen to all my music with one app. I know xmms has a WAV  plugin, but it does not recognise these either.Any help will be greatly appreciated!Cheers, John Gay --  Irish Linux Users&#x27; Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

"fw : thanksgiving - note from sherriff fyi - in case you hadn &#x27; t seen it . . . . - - - - - original message - - - - - from : enron europe general announcement / ect @ ect on behalf of enron europe office of the chairman sent : 22 november 2001 05 : 48 to : ect europe @ enron ; ect asia pacific @ enron subject : thanksgiving today is thanksgiving . a uniquely american holiday , it is one that i personally value the most . it has no religious significance , and is not tied to any historical pagan celebration . it does not spring from mythology and carries with it very little baggage . no presents are exchanged ; decorations are few and spare ; there is little commercial pressure to buy , travel , celebrate , or do anything to excess . ( the possible exceptions are the temptations to overeat and watch too much football . ) thanksgiving is a holiday designated by men and women - a day specifically set aside to enjoy friends and family and to ponder our good fortune . as most of you know , the first thanksgiving was held in new england - a bountiful feast during which the american forefathers joined with native americans to celebrate a good harvest . this celebration drew a line under a dreadful year of enormous suffering - inadequate food supplies , disease and death . this is a very difficult time for all of us at enron . i want to take a few minutes of your time to share with you some of my thoughts - for even now , it is important to count our blessings and recall some of the many things for which we can be thankful . i am thankful for the way all of you have pulled together each day , doing your best to make the most of a really tough situation . i am moved by the kind words many of you have shared with me . i have been impressed by your willingness to look forward , stay the course , and maintain your sense of humor . your loyalty and commitment have sustained me during some of our darkest moments . i am grateful for friends , family , and the opportunity to live and work in a free and open society . mostly , i am so very proud of you - your talents , your flexibility , your work ethic , your willingness to hang in there when things seem to be spinning out of control . thanks for constantly reminding me how lucky i am to be working with you . john sherriff",0

"Normally, I disdain any kind of mysticism, even when it is associated  with fairly good ideas.  Just a big turnoff.  A good example would be  the difference between Yoga/TM and the more scientifically pure, but  related, relaxation techniques including &quot;betagenics&quot;,  hypnosis/auto-hypnosis, etc.  (This was one of the many topics I  obsessively absorbed as a teenager.)  Or Tai Chi etc. vs. Tai Bo /  G-Force Dyno-Staff.I have to say however that, having found this while looking for  something completely unrelated, it has some cute truisms.  I  particularly like their addiction to non-addiction.  Additionally, the  Mindprod treehugger site has some interesting quotes, etc.To my internal ear, nearly all of these 60&#x27;s based new-age vernacular  seem to assume that you are a simple child (of the 60&#x27;s?) who needs some  religion-like couching of ideas to relate and internalize.  Very  irritating, but taken in small doses it&#x27;s interesting to compare and  contrast with our (my) modern mental models.I found that a few of the principles could be used to explain and  justify US/UN foreign policy and actions.http://mindprod.com/methods.html http://members.aol.com/inossence/Kenkey.html http://www.mindprod.com/ (Apologies for the embedded HTML.)We create the world we live in. A loving person lives in a loving world, A hostile person lives in a hostile world. Everyone you meet is your mirror.You make yourself and others suffer just as much when you take offence  as when you give offence. To be upset over what you don&#x27;t have is to  waste what you do have.The past is dead, The future is imaginary, Happiness can only be in the Eternal Now MomentHow soon will you realize that the only thing you don&#x27;t have is the  direct experience that there&#x27;s nothing you need that you don&#x27;t have.Love a person because he or she is there. This is the only reason.Happiness happens when your consciousness is not dominated by addictions  and demands~ and you experience life as a parade of preferences.The purpose of our lives is to be free of all addictive traps, and thus become one with the ocean of Living Love. sdw--  sdw@lig.net http://sdw.st Stephen D.

"Hi everybody!I&#x27;m writing a web application in java (tomcat + jsp/servlets + database  access with postgreSQL).This will be released under the GPL and will eventually be useful as a  framework for other web applications.The application main focus is e-commerce, but not limited to that.I would like to use some form of cryptography to protect data on the  database, but I have some problem figuring out the right approach.Above all, how to store passwords and keys in a shared web server.A problem that I was unable to solve is how to store keys for  encryption/decryption. The api that I&#x27;m using is the jca (jdk1.4.x),  and the methods of saving generated keys in keystores fails always. I can serialize the object, and store in the database, but this is not  the most secure approach: this key is needed to decrypt data in the  database, but the database is accessible from the web application.  Assuming that I can find a good and secure place where to store the  database password, I can use a different database with different  user... Argh... to complex and doesn&#x27;t really solve the problem.Where I can found good documentation about this topic?There is another approach that I would share with the list, something I  thought that can be of bit interest, but probabily wrong and insecure.  After all, I&#x27;m a real beginner in secure programming, and I&#x27;m here to  learn methods and technics.First of all, I need a secure way to keep database passwords secure, so  I have to keep them separate from the main server. The right approach  could be using a small java bean application that run as normal user  (not tomcat, so it is not shared with other web services or, worst, the  nobody user), that has no shell login, but has a default home directory  or a place where it can hold passwords and keys.The web application could then open an ssl connection (could be done in  the init method at server startup) to get database passwords. The small  bean could check via code signature/rmi/whatever else that the source  is the right one, and handle all the database connections, or give the  db connection/password to the main web application.In this way, we solve the problem of keeping the keys and passwords in  shared directories, and also, an attacker should get root/bean user  account to read data. This is not perfect, and works only if your  provider gives the opportunity to configure a separated java  application (that means, really, another server running in the  background).Any suggestions?Thank you, Mario Torre --  Please avoid sending me Word or PowerPoint attachments.

This concept could also be &gt; applied to the application servers, and even the database server partitions &gt; (except for those partitions which contain the table data files, of course.) Although the data might just be the information that needs protecting.&gt; Does anyone do this already? Or is this a new concept? I&#x27;ve seen this implemented for a shell server, although they chose to have their root on a CD-WR in a CD-R drive. Which meant that even when compromised it was only possible to examine other users data.  AFAIR(emember) they just swapped CD&#x27;s when a root exploit was found.&gt; Thanks for any opinions,NPblaze your trail -- redhat&#x27;I am become Shiva, destroyer of worlds&#x27; ",0

" JH&gt; They are legally required to do that.  I got a similar check because an JH&gt; insurance company didn&#x27;t pay a claim quickly enough.  It might have been JH&gt; $.02.JH&gt; Although they spent lots more than $.33 to mail you the check, the JH&gt; alternative seems to be to keep the money.  Do you really want companies JH&gt; to have a financial incentive to over-bill you &#x27;just a bit&#x27; so they JH&gt; could keep it?  For a company with millions of customers, $.33/customer JH&gt; starts adding up. Christ, you sound worse than me.What I -said- in my post, John, was that instead of having to dole out stupid refunds, I&#x27;d rather they save the costs incurred, knock off one of those bullshit surcharges that they inevitably charge for promoting services like these, and move on.  SOmething tells me, it&#x27;d balance out.  Problem is, they&#x27;re silly, they don&#x27;t want to do this, and rather than the legislation coming up with an affective means of controlling the situation (overcharging) they impose silly requirements like this. &gt;&gt; From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of &gt;&gt; bitbitch@magnesium.net&gt;&gt; So I get a check from Pac Bell today (SBC as they&#x27;re called now). &gt;&gt; Turns out, they went to the trouble of printing out, signing, sealing &gt;&gt; and stamping a check just to refund me for a whole $0.33. &gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; They easily spent more than this just getting the materials together. &gt;&gt; Why the hell do companies bother to do this crap?  I mean, isn&#x27;t there &gt;&gt; a bottom line in terms of cost effectiveness?  I don&#x27;t think I missed &gt;&gt; the .33, but I sure as hell would have appreciated lower rates in lieu &gt;&gt; of being returned pennies. &gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m truly stuck on this though.  I don&#x27;t know whether to frame the &gt;&gt; check, burn it, or cash it in.  Maybe I should find a way to return to &gt;&gt; sender, so they have to spend -more- money on giving me my .33 dues. &gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; Does .33 even buy anything anymore?

"&gt; &gt; GAB&gt; The problem is that politics have gotten so muddied &gt; GAB&gt; nowadays, that shouting down and unpeaceably disrupting &gt; GAB&gt; political rallies that you don&#x27;t agree with has become &gt; GAB&gt; common practice.  The courts have constantly ruled &gt; GAB&gt; that there are some restrictions on the first amendment. &gt; GAB&gt; They teach you that your very first year of law school. &gt; &gt; I&#x27;ll agree with Owen on this one.  Muddied my ass.  How hard is it to &gt; chose between a Republocrat or a Demipublican?   Not very.  Shouting &gt; down has grown to become the answer because the government, over a &gt; span of years, and with the help of the Courts -has- limited the &gt; rights we have as citizens under the First Amendment.Wishful thinking. People are just bigger dickheads now. Culture is changing and it is becoming acceptable to get in peoples face and shout them down when you disagree with them.  The people that do this are NOT disenfranchised. They get their rocks off on being disagreeable assholes. The act of protesting is more important than the actual issue being protested for most of these people.&gt; question the policy about terrorism, or drugs, or Iraq, or Bush in &gt; general, you&#x27;re aiding terrorism.   If you challenge the beliefs of &gt; the folks attending the various shadowy G8 conferences, you&#x27;re an &gt; anarchist, and you&#x27;re herded off to a &#x27;designated protest spot&#x27; miles &gt; away from anything.   Part of the point of speech is to be -heard-. &gt; I can scream on my soapbox in the forest somewhere, and while thats &gt; speech, its not effective speech.  People are screaming and shouting &gt; over the political figures because they cannot be  heard in any other &gt; way.And where does this end? Shouting down speakers is an obviously stupid tactic if they are -really- interested in advocating change. Are they such clueless social morons that they don&#x27;t see this or are they just interested in stroking their pathetic egos?OBTW, &#x27;clueless social moron syndrom&#x27; does not have political boundaries.Bill ",0

"Dear friend,I am Mrs. Sese-seko widow of late President Mobutu Sese-seko of Zaire, now known as Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). I am moved to write you this letter. This was in confidence considering my present circumstance and situation. I escaped along with my husband and two of our sons James Kongolo and Nzanga out of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Abidjan, Coted&#x27;ivoire where my family and I settled, while we later moved to settled in Morroco where my husband later died of cancer disease. However, due to this situation we decided to change most of my husband&#x27;s billions of dollars deposited in Swiss bank and other countries into other forms of money coded for safe purpose because the new head of state of (Dr) Mr Laurent Kabila has made arrangement with the Swiss government and other European countries to freeze all my late husband&#x27;s treasures deposited in some european countries. Hence, my children and I decided laying low in Africa to study the situation till when things gets better. Like now that president Kabila is dead and the son taking over (Joseph Kabila). One of my late husband&#x27;s chateaux in Southern France was confiscated by the french government, and as such I had to change my identity so that my investment will not be traced and confiscated.I have deposited the sum Eighteen Million United State Dollars (US$18,000,000,00.) With a security company for safe keeping. What I want you to do is to indicate yourinterest that you can assist us in receiving the money on our behalf, so that I can introduce you to my son (Kongolo) who has the out modalities for the claim of the said funds. I want you to assist in investing this money, but I will not want my identity revealed.I will also want to acquire real/landed properties and stock in multi-national companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments as adviseby your good self. May I at this point emphasize the high level of confidentiality, which this upcoming project demands,and hope you will not betray the trust and confidence, which I repose in you.In conclusion, if you want to assist us, my son (Kongolo) shall divulgeto you all briefs regarding this project, tell you where the funds are currently being maintained and also discuss remuneration for your services.For this reason kindly furnish us your contact information,that is your personal telephone and fax number for validation purpose and acknowledge receipt of this mail using the above email address.Yours sincerely,Mrs. Mariam M.

"&quot;the historical record&quot;, by which you mean *human* historical record, is highly overrated (nigh worthless) when you are talking about geological timescales, even on topics with as short a timescale as climate.My problem with global warming (or cooling for that matter), is that the supposedly profound recent changes in temperature, both in absolute terms and as a function time, very arguably fall well below the noise floor of the natural fluctuations that have occurred over the last 50,000 years both in terms of absolute average temperature and the rate of temperature change.  People unfamiliar with history of global temperature since the advent of modern humans may think that a degree here or there over a century is a lot, not realizing that global temperatures regularly whipsaw with far greater extremity.  I therefore  immediately dismiss any theory of global warming that cannot explain why temperatures whipsawed more severely in pre-history than in the last couple thousand years (which have been relatively calm by geological standards).  This is a very inconvenient fact for people trying to use climate to push a particular social agenda.It is worth noting that underneath the receding glaciers deposited during the last major ice age, they are finding substantial evidence of humans living in what was a nice temperate climate before the glaciers paved over their civilization.  The receding glaciers have turned into a bit of an archaeological treasure chest, as they expose artifacts buried in and underneath them as they shrink that have been preserved by the ice for thousands of years.  I don&#x27;t see any compelling reason to &quot;save the glaciers&quot; anyway, particularly in light of the fact that their existence has always been transient.For anyone to insist that the current negligible fluctuations are anthropogenic just heaps one ridiculous assertion upon another.  I&#x27;ll just stick with Occam&#x27;s Razor for now.In my humble opinion.Cheers,-James Rogers  jamesr@best.com On Mon, 2002-09-23 at 12:23, Jim Whitehead wrote: &gt;  &gt; For anyone to fully bury global warming, they would need to explain why the &gt; dramatic increase in CO2 concentrations are not increasing the global &gt; temperature. They would also need to explain why, worldwide, glaciers are &gt; melting faster than they have previously in the historical record. That is, &gt; people need more than refutations, they need a compelling alternate &gt; explanation (hint: climate variability doesn&#x27;t cover all the bases).",0

Nonetheless, Microsoft has tried to spread FUD about the viral nature of the GPL to make CEO/CIO level people (often not the most technically clueful, even the CIOs) fear that if they so much as use a Linux box, as, say, a print server, they&#x27;ll have to make their company&#x27;s entire IP public.

The lawsuits prevented the Forest Service  from implementation of any project that involved tree removal.  These  projects were designed to address the tree and undergrowth density that  resulted from previous management policies.In other words, Forest Service projects to clean up the mess resulting from  their previous forest management practices are prevented by tree lover  lawsuits. &gt; 40 years after the end of the containment policy there is still a lot of  stuff  &gt; left to burn.Exactly, and tree lover lawsuits are preventing the removal of that  stuff.  The result:  Fires like Cerro Grande. &gt; I can&#x27;t imagine that artificially planted replacement  &gt; forests ...There are very few replacement forests planted these days.

"affricates - - one segment or two the recent query and summary by larry trask on german affricates makes me think of the fact that , unless i am mistaken , it is perfectly easy to hear the difference between one - and two-segment stop-fricative sequences at least in some cases . polish has a contrast of this sort at least in initial position , where the words spelled _ trzy _ and _ czy _ differ only in that the former has a cluster , the second an affricate . also , if you compare the english way of saying _ ts _ with the german way of saying _ z _ ( or the polish or the yiddish , etc . ) , there is an audible difference . most english speakers &#x27; rendition of _ matzah _ ( or _ matzoh _ ) for example sounds quite different from the yiddish or polish , but ( and this is also very suggestive ) i have found a few am . engl . speakers ( not all of them jewish , by the way ) who have the affricate , i . e . , one-segment / ts / in this and perhaps some other yiddish borrowings but the two segment / t / + / s / otherwise , so that these speakers do not rhyme _ matzah _ and _ lots o ( f ) _ , whereas most speakers do . finally , i think some speakers have a one-segment / ts / in hit ya , but a two-segment / t / + / s / in hits ya , although most speakers i have asked refuse to admit anything but the nonpalatalized , non-affricated pronunciation in the second case . alexis mr",0

" New Page 1Hi,            Want to increase your chances of winning a big jackpot in those             Internet contests?            Michael Khalili, the famous programmer who you may have read about             in USA Today and other newspapers, came up with a method that makes             it hundreds of times easier to win online.            He recently wrote a program that will AUTOMATICALLY enter you in             online contests--over and over UNTIL YOU WIN (or tell it to stop).             We at Grab.com are so excited by this system that we&#x27;re putting it             online for our members to use.             THE PRIZE IS YOURS - GUARANTEED!            If you win a contest using this program, the prize is legally yours             to keep--GUARANTEED! Our lawyers assured us that Michael&#x27;s program             is legal, and online contest sponsors have CONFIRMED that it doesn&#x27;t             violate their rules. So if you win a prize, you&#x27;ll receive it.             If you don&#x27;t receive it, we&#x27;ll pay you ourselves. GUARANTEED.             FREE TO USE.            Best of all, this service is free to use. All you pay for is related             network expenses--which only cost $1 for 7 days of the service.             That&#x27;s dozens of entries for what you&#x27;d usually pay to get a single             lottery ticket!            As a member in good standing of this mailing, we&#x27;ve already             set up the automatic entry system for you. All that&#x27;s left             is for you to turn it on. Once you do, you can sit back and watch it             enter you into contest after contest after contest after contest.... Click             here to begin!            P.S. This system will continue to enter you into hundreds of free             contests until you win (or cancel it).            P.P.S.

Some would say they were actually last to market.  The  only thing that was first about this is what they&#x27;re calling &quot;nationwide  coverage&quot;, and you could even (and perhaps should) argue with that.&gt;   to me, there is nada more interesting and impactful going &gt;down in the tech world than mobile visual communications.. and yet no one &gt;seems to give much of a damn that right now that 2 persons can take photos &gt;and share them instantly across space.  this is one of the biggest - and &gt;last - fundamental changes in human communications.  will be as big as the &gt;browser.Can you clarify why you think this is so?I&#x27;m in the midst of an ongoing argument with a guy who works for me about  this very subject.  He, like you, thinks that things like MMS are going to  change the world.  I am not convinced.What exactly about sending pictures to each other is going to have such a  huge impact?  I&#x27;m waiting to be convinced.  I just don&#x27;t see how it changes  human communication in any really amazing way - and no one who believes it  has yet done a good job explaining it to me.  I can understand SMS taking  off, since communicating short text messages can be very useful in many  situations.  However, I just don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s the compelling reason for  sending pictures around to each other on a regular basis.  Are there  instances when it makes sense?  Sure, I can think of plenty where it&#x27;s a  nice to have, but very few where it would be a &quot;man, I need this&quot; type of  feature.I mean, right now, at my desk, it&#x27;s easy for me to text message with lots  of people, and I do all the time.  If I wanted to, I could also very easily  snap a picture and send it to them, but I don&#x27;t.  I did once, after I got a  really bad haircut, and a friend wanted to see how it looked - but that&#x27;s a  fairly limited use.  Obviously, that&#x27;s just one case, and maybe I&#x27;m just  too old (argh!) to really &quot;get&quot; this new photo taking and sharing stuff,  but I&#x27;m really trying to understand.So, I&#x27;m not saying it won&#x27;t be a &quot;fundamental change in human  communications&quot;, but I&#x27;d just like to know why you think it will be?Mike http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",0

"update : ffvols ted , an update on the implementation for ffvols : ( 1 ) in comparing 6 days of historical var calculations ( with that of the implied ) for agg - gas , we have found that the historical var calculations are consistently lower over this period , by roughly 17 mm . the implied volatilities are much higher at this period , anticipating strong winter prices . ( 2 ) at this time , the consensus is not to relase the historical implementation into production , and the official line to traders will be that the method is still in testing . the historical var is 19 . 2 mm and the implied is 37 mm for effective date of 09 / 25 . ( 3 ) further testing is in progress on a hybrid methodology ( which i mentioned last week , whereby historical vols are scaled by the ratio of prompt to historical - prompt volatilities ) , to atleast capture some implied / forward effects . tanya &#x27; s analysis on a fictitious portfolio indicates higher var numbers , but poorer backtesting in comparison to the historical approach . this approach serves as an intermediate , and seems appropriate in periods such as the current one , wherein the historical numbers might be considerably lower than those of the implied . ( 4 ) winston will start testing using these hybrid vols , and if the results are deemed satisfactory , that will be the production methodology . of course , we will obtain all var numbers concurrently to serve as different indicators and beacons of risk . the production number will hopefully be a sensible compromise of the different methods . regards naveen",0

Bush proclaimed, &quot;The problem with the French is that they don&#x27;t have a word for entrepreneur.&quot; Origins:   Yet another French fried &quot;George W. Bush is dumb&quot; story has been taken up by those who like their caricatures drawn in stark, bold lines. According to scuttlebutt that emerged in the British press in July 2002, President Bush, Britain&#x27;s Prime Minister Tony Blair, and France&#x27;s President Jacques Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular, the decline of the French economy. &quot;The problem with the French,&quot; Bush afterwards confided in Blair, &quot;is that they don&#x27;t have a word for entrepreneur.&quot;The source was Shirley Williams, also known as the Baroness Williams of Crosby, who claimed &quot;my good friend Tony Blair&quot; had recently regaled her with this anecdote in Brighton.Lloyd Grove of The Washington Post was unable to reach Baroness Williams to gain her confirmation of the tale, but he did receive a call from Alastair Campbell, Blair&#x27;s director of communications and strategy. &quot;I can tell you that the prime minister never heard George Bush say that, and he certainly never told Shirley Williams that President Bush did say it,&quot; Campbell told The Post. &quot;If she put this in a speech, it must have been a joke.&quot;This is far from the first time Bush has been made the butt of a jibe meant to showcase what some perceive as his less than stellar intellectual abilities. Without straining our memories too hard, we can come up with three other instances we&#x27;ve chronicled on this site. In the summer of 2001, the joke of the moment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in the ranking of Presidential IQs, with George W. Bush being pegged as the Chief Executive who scraped the bottom of the intelligence barrel. In December 2000 it was a fake Nostradamus quatrain which pontificated that the &quot;village idiot&quot; would win the 2000 Presidential election. And in the spring of 2002, it was the story of Bush&#x27;s waving at Stevie Wonder that set folks to chortling up their sleeves.Stories that illustrate this widely believed intellectual shortcoming will always waft after George W. Bush because they seemingly confirm what many already hold as true about this public figure, that he&#x27;s not the brightest fellow that&#x27;s ever been. It is human nature to revel in yarns that the hearer at some level agrees with, thus tales of this sort will always fall upon appreciative ears.Barbara &quot;ears of corn&quot; MikkelsonLast updated:   29 July 2002http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",0

"If you need to store a database password, then clearly the first step is to store the text outside the web tree.  You can encrypt it and store the encryption key elsewhere, so that at least an attacker has to get two different things. Also, don&#x27;t get full privileges - create a user account that is GRANTed very limited access.However, you can often do better than this if security is critical.  Create a separate program which has these database keys (as noted above), and make the web program contact IT.  Create a very limited protocol that ONLY lets you do the operations you need (you can add specific operations later).  There&#x27;s a performance hit, which you&#x27;re trading for improved data isolation.Giorgio Zoppi wrote:&gt; On Fri, Aug 23, 2002, David Wheeler wrote: &gt;  &gt;  &gt;&gt;The standard way to store passwords is... not to &gt;&gt;store passwords.  Instead, store a salted hash of &gt;&gt;the password in a database.  When you get a purported &gt;&gt;password, you re-salt it, compute the hash, and &gt;&gt;determine if they are the same.  This is how &gt;&gt;Unix has done it for years.  You want bigger hashes &gt;&gt;and salts than the old Unix systems, and you still want &gt;&gt;to prevent reading from those files (to foil password crackers). &gt;&gt;More info is in my book at: &gt;&gt;   http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-programs &gt;&gt; &gt;  &gt; Well...but this cannot be applied to database password, which most &gt; web apps use.

I created a new user alfio into whose home directory I copied alfred&#x27;s .ssh directory - alfio can wander around free as a bird without being asked for a password ever (except of course for the passphrase to load the identiy into the agent).In case there was something else in Alfred&#x27; environment, I copied .??* from alfred&#x27;s home directory to alfio&#x27;s, remembering to change ownership afterwards. Still alfio is as free as a bird.We use only SSH2 with DSA keys. An extract from a ssh -v for alfio is belowdebug1: got SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT debug1: authentications that can continue: publickey,password debug1: next auth method to try is publickey debug1: userauth_pubkey_agent: testing agent key /home/alfio/.ssh/id_dsa debug1: input_userauth_pk_ok: pkalg ssh-dss blen 434 lastkey 0x80916f0 hint -1 debug1: ssh-userauth2 successful: method publickeyand before starting this ssh attempt, ssh-add -l for alfio said:1024 07:4c:7c:90:0d:28:41:3a:95:c2:81:3d:ba:c4:3d:03 /home/alfio/.ssh/id_dsa (DSA)whereas with alfred the same segment of the debug log wentdebug1: got SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT debug1: authentications that can continue: publickey,password debug1: next auth method to try is publickey debug1: userauth_pubkey_agent: testing agent key /nfshome/alfred/.ssh/id_dsa debug1: authentications that can continue: publickey,passwordand before starting this ssh attempt, ssh-add -l for alfred said:1024 07:4c:7c:90:0d:28:41:3a:95:c2:81:3d:ba:c4:3d:03 /home/alfred/.ssh/id_dsa (DSA) This problem is definitely related to alfred as a user - it happens when he logs in on differing workstations (all NFS mounting the same home directories) and the other users (including good old alfio) don&#x27;t have any problems.

I&#x27;m working with an experimental text recognition/processing engine that exhibits similar characteristics.  It can read right through misspellings like the above without any difficulty.  And as the author above suggested, the pattern matching is inherently parallel internally.If the text recognition algorithm/architecture humans use is anything like the algorithm/structure we&#x27;ve been working with, the reason the first letter (and to a lesser extent, the last letter) is important is that without it the text pattern recognition problem is exponentially more difficult (from a theoretical standpoint anyway) and has to be resolved using deeper abstraction analysis.  The middle letters are far less important and computationally much easier to resolve correctly.  Cheers,-James Rogers  jamesr@best.com ",0

"summary : chomsky on letting the theory choose i recently asked where it was that chomsky said that in unclear cases we should let the theory choose the right analysis . the answer , supplied by jan odijk , barbara abbott , and michael israel ( to all of whom my thanks ) turns out to be syntactic structures , p . 14 : . . . in order to set the aims of grammar significantly it is sufficient to assume a partial knowledge of sentences and non-sentences . that is , we may assume for this discussion that certain sequences of phonemes are definitely sentences , and that certain others sequences are definitely non-sentences . in many intermediate cases we shall be prepared to let the grammar itself decide , when the grammar is set up in the simplest way so that it includes the clear sentences and excludes the clear non-sentences . . . . a certain number of clear cases , then will provide us with a criterion of adequacy for any particular grammar .",0

But I&#x27;d be willing to keep those ones in, all the same.  What &gt; do you think?  Matt/Craig, thoughts?I think I could handle commenting out the lowest SPAM_PHRASE_XX_YY scores.  If the GA could handle this sort of thing so they&#x27;d automatically be zeroed, I&#x27;d feel better since the ranges could change next time the phrase list is regenerated or the algorithm tweaked.I think we need to understand why DATE_IN_PAST_48_96 is so low before we remove it.  The two rules on either side perform quite well.&gt;&gt; And here are the rules that seem like they should be better or should &gt;&gt; be recoverable:&gt;&gt;&gt;   FROM_MISSING &gt;&gt;&gt;   GAPPY_TEXT &gt;&gt;&gt;   INVALID_MSGID &gt;&gt;&gt;   MIME_NULL_BLOCK &gt;&gt;&gt;   SUBJ_MISSING&gt; well, I don&#x27;t like SUBJ_MISSING, I reckon there&#x27;s a world of mails from &gt; cron jobs (e.g.) which hit it.Okay, drop SUBJ_MISSING.&gt; But, yes, the others for sure should be recoverable, and I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s &gt; more.Probably a few, those seemed like the best prospects to me.&gt; BTW do you agree with the proposed methodology (ie. remove the rules and &gt; bugzilla each one?)I only want a bugzilla ticket for each one if people are okay with quick WONTFIX closes on the ones deemed unworthy of recovery.If you could put the stats for each rule in the ticket somehow (should be automatable with email at the very least), it would help.Dan ",0

"speeding up your hiring process hiring managers , here are a few tips that will immediately improve the time it takes to make a offer to your candidates . all applicants must fill out and sign an application and a fair credit reporting act form ( included with the application ) prior to being interviewed . you may either have the applicant fill out a form before you interview them or you can send the applicant to the 36 th floor to fill out the forms before you interview them . notify hector mcloughlin or frank dejesus if you are interviewing an external candidate that is a former enron employee . all previous enron employees will be reviewed by hr and sally beck prior to being invited to interview . we hope that this process will eliminate re - hiring poor performers . if you want to make an offer of employment to a candidate for a management position , please include sally beck in the process for input . as a final step of the selection process , sally would like to meet with the candidate if time allows or to phone interview the candidate as an alternative . sally &#x27; s involvement should occur after you have identified the candidate as a potential management new hire . thanks for your help with this process . ena energy ops human resources team",0

"on becoming a linguist i too have a theory on why linguistics attracted many of us . as a field it ranges from the humanities to the hard sciences , with the majority of its subdisciplines falling into the general area of social sciences . i have spoken with many linguists who started their scholarly lives as scientists ( chem - istry , physics . . . ) and wanted something which seemed more like a humanities discipline ( often in the more european sense of ` sciences humaines &#x27; , disciplines which deal with people ) , while many others ( including myself ) started in foreign languages and literatures and found we wanted something more scientific than literary analysis . i think the second-language learning component of it is important , as suggested in a posting i read today , but not always because of * difficulty * with learning a language ; but rather a desire to keep working with language in some form without doing literature . on a personal note , i can clearly remember my relief , as an undergraduate , to discover linguistics through a comparative romance course . it meant that majoring in french made sense even if sartre did n&#x27;t ! margaret",0

"sexism and language re lydie e . meunier &#x27;s latest , i did not mean to say that i consider oppression of any kind to be of no importance , but merely that in studying linguistic usages it is of no importance ( or at least less importance , ok ? ) what the real situation re oppression and the like is than what people perceive it to be . if ( as some seem to believe ) there is no oppression of women by men , i meant to say , that would not be what we would want to know in order to explain sexist language , so long as people believe that men are better , stronger , or whatever , so long as people believe that men are and deserve to be dominant and / or more prominent in public life , etc . because even if these things were not true ( although i think by large they obviously are ) , so long as people believe they are ( and certainly all cultures i am familiar with do ) , then that would suffice to explain sexist language . in the same way , we as linguists need not discuss the existence of god in order to be able to say that certain linguistic usages seem to be derived from such a belief . so , yes , i do believe women have been and continue to be oppressed in various ways , i am astounded that there are people who would deny it , but i also would say that in order to explain sexist language , that is not what we need to discuss . alexis manaster ramer",0

[...]Another theory is that Europe was a rural backyard until the Renaissance, certainly when compared to big urban centres like Constantinople and Baghdad.I don&#x27;t know the genetic studies of which you speak, but I know of one that is sort-of relevant: apparently men of Ashkenazi descent are susceptible to sickle-cell anemia and the probable reason is that the same genetic factor that causes that also protects women from tuberculosis (IIRC), which would have come in handy in central European towns at a time when the Jewish population was a lot more urbanised than average Joes.R http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",0

"Dan Kohn  writes:&gt; Guys, the Habeas Infringers List (HIL) exists explicitly to deal with &gt; spammers while we&#x27;re getting judgments against them and especially in &gt; other countries, where those judgments are harder to get.My concern doesn&#x27;t stem from failing to understand how your business is intended to work.  My concern is the lack of empirical evidence that it will reduce the amount of uncaught spam.&gt; Please note that nobody has ever had an incentive before to go after &gt; regular spammers.  Yes, some attorneys general have prosecuted blatant &gt; pyramid schemes, and ISPs have won some theft of service suits, but &gt; the vast majority of spammers go forward with out any legal hassles. &gt; So, I can&#x27;t understand how Daniel can assert that you can&#x27;t track &gt; spammers down when it&#x27;s never really been tried.Please don&#x27;t misquote me.  I did not assert that you &quot;can&#x27;t track spammers&quot;.  Here is what I said:| It will be difficult to find, prosecute, and win money from someone in | various non-friendly countries where spam originates (China is a good | example) even if they do officially &quot;respect&quot; copyright law.I understand the incentive that you have to pursue spammers, but that does not directly translate to less spam being sent to my inbox.  It is an indirect effect and the magnitude of the effect may not be sufficient to counteract the ease with which a -20 score on the mark allows spam to avoid being tagged as spam.&gt; Daniel, it&#x27;s easy enough for you to change the Habeas scores yourself &gt; on your installation.  If Habeas fails to live up to its promise to &gt; only license the warrant mark to non-spammers and to place all &gt; violators on the HIL, then I have no doubt that Justin and Craig will &gt; quickly remove us from the next release.  But, you&#x27;re trying to kill &gt; Habeas before it has a chance to show any promise.I think I&#x27;ve worked on SA enough to understand that I can localize a score.  I&#x27;m just not comfortable with using SpamAssassin as a vehicle for drumming up your business at the expense of our user base.I think it would make more sense to start Habeas with a less aggressive score (one which will not give spammers a quick path into everyone&#x27;s inbox) and after we&#x27;ve seen evidence that the system works, then we can increase the magnitude of the score.Dan ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven. http://thinkgeek.com/sf _______________________________________________ Spamassassin-talk mailing list Spamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk",0

"Robin Lynn Frank  writes:&gt; I may be dense, but why would anyone want to utilize Habeus?  To me, &gt; it looks like a potential backdoor to anyone&#x27;s defenses against spam. &gt; &gt; If I were a spammer, I&#x27;d simply set up a server, send out my spam with &gt; the Habeus headers and continue till I was reasonably certain I&#x27;d been &gt; reported.  Then I&#x27;d simply reconfigure the server and reconnect to a &gt; different IP.  As long as no one can establish my connection to the &gt; web sites my spam is directing people to, I&#x27;m home free.Here is the bug I opened:  http://www.hughes-family.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=762RBLs have the same problem, but there is no negative RBL header rule with a -20 score that can be forged, so the problem is unique to Habeas.&gt; Since I can set up spamassassin to I don&#x27;t &quot;lose&quot; any email, what do I &gt; gain by making it easier for spam to get through??My primary issue is the magnitude of the negative score and that it was not determined empirically.  I am also concerned that it was added after the rules freeze, that such a major change was not discussed in advance, etc.There&#x27;s also no evidence that the rule will actually reduce FPs.  People who are smart enough to use the rule are probably capable of writing email that doesn&#x27;t look like spam (I&#x27;m not counting spam mailing lists which you need to be exempted from spam filtering).Dan ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by: Jabber - The world&#x27;s fastest growing  real-time communications platform!

" MR. AYANDA MAREDI DEPARTMENT OF MINERALS AND ENERGY PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA. Good morning,It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on behalf of my colleagues. I venture to write to you perhaps you will see it fit to assist my colleagues and I in all honesty as we attempt to seek your assistance.I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of a deal hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it confidential because of the nature of this business.Within the Department of Minerals and Energy where I work as a Director of Audit and Project implementation, with the co-operation of two other top officials, we have in our possession an overdue payment in US funds.The said funds represent certain percentage of the contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced to the amount of US$29,200,000.00 (Twenty-Nine Million Two Hundred Thousand US Dollars). Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the excess balance unclaimed.Since the present elected Government is determined to pay foreign contractors all debts owed, so as to maintain good relations with foreign governments and non-governmental agencies, we included our bills for approvals with the Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank of South Africa (RBSA). We are seeking your assistance to front as the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts. Details and change of beneficiary information upon application for claim to reflect payment and approvals will be secured on behalf of You/your Company.I have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in this transaction your share as compensation will be US$7.3m (25%) while my colleagues and I receive US$18.98m (65%) and the balance of US$2.92m (10%) for taxes and miscellaneous expenses incurred.This business is completely safe and secure, provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality. It does notmatter whether You/your Company does contract projects, as a transfer of powers will be secured in favour of You/your Company. Also, your specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint us.Kindly notify me by telephone on 27-83-750 9598 or fax 27-73-219 9975 for further details upon your acceptance of this proposal.May God&#x27;s blessings be with you even as you reply.Regards, MR. AYANDA MAREDI ",1

"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85534626 Date: Not suppliedAfter discovering an open wireless net available from his sofa, Steven  &quot;Hackers&quot; Levy interviewed lawmen, academics and WiFi activists about the  legality and ethics of using open wireless access points.     I downloaded my mail and checked media news on the Web. When I confessed      this to FBI agent Bill Shore, he spared the handcuffs. &quot;The FBI wouldn&#x27;t      waste resources on that,&quot; he sniffed. Now I know that if it did, it would      be hard to argue that I broke a law. What&#x27;s more, I certainly didn&#x27;t feel      illegal. Becauseï¿½and this is the point of all that war-driving and      -chalking and node-stumblingï¿½when you get used to wireless, the experience      feels more and more like a God-given right.

It isn&#x27;t far from stealing the only food my children have so I&#x27;ll have to watch them starve. The margin of survival is very, very, thin.So yes. In my particular reality distortion field &#x27;not paying for a little food&#x27; in India is akin to a direct act of violence intended to cause suffering if not death on the victims family. That such an act triggers a violent response is, IMHO, hardly surprising.In other words, as far as I could tell the people on the train fired the first shot.With all of that said I still don&#x27;t know if this happened or not. Nor do I know for sure that the margin of survival for those Muslim vendors was that thin. &gt; -----Original Message----- &gt; From: Stephen D. Williams [mailto:swilliams@hpti.com] &gt; Sent: Monday, September 16, 2002 11:54 AM &gt; To: johnhall@evergo.net &gt; Cc: fork@spamassassin.taint.org; lea@lig.net &gt; Subject: Re: Slaughter in the Name of God &gt; &gt; Wow! It seems you are evaluating this with a large reality distortion &gt; field. &gt; &gt; If the activists on the train refused to pay for food, then the vendors &gt; shouldn&#x27;t give it to them. And the local police force should be &gt; arresting them. Etc. &gt; &gt; You have to be operating from a particularly primitive point of view, &gt; which obviously was in operation with the participants here, to think &gt; that religious differences or not being paid for a little food (or &gt; taunting!) was even a remote justification for burning a train full of &gt; people alive. &gt; &gt; sdw &gt; &gt; John Hall wrote: &gt; &gt; What I understood was that the activists on the train refused to pay for &gt; &gt; the food and other items they acquired from the Muslim vendors -- then &gt; &gt; taunted them. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That may not be true, but it would put things in a more interesting &gt; &gt; light. Taking food from a small vendor in India and not paying them is &gt; &gt; trying to starve them. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It sounded consistent with the ideas and purpose of the train full of &gt; &gt; activists. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;m rarely an apologist for Muslims anywhere. Yet I find my sympathies &gt; &gt; with the Muslims in this case, even after they burned the train. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of &gt; &gt;&gt;Stephen D. Williams &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;The pity of it is that some &gt; &gt;&gt;Muslims were ready to give it to them. Their murderous attack on the &gt; &gt;&gt;train-load of VHP activists at Godhra (with its awful, atavistic &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; echoes &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;of the killings of Hindus and Muslims by the train-load during the &gt; &gt;&gt;partition riots of 1947) played right into the Hindu extremists&#x27; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hands. &gt; &gt; sdw &gt; -- &gt; swilliams@hpti.com http://www.hpti.com &gt; Stephen D.

"a cry for help dear friend , greetings to you and your family ! this mail might come to you as a surprise and the temptation to ignore it as unserious could come into your mind ; but please consider it a divine wish and accept it with a deep sense of humility . my name is jose a . martinez . i am a 64 years old man , i am cuban currently residing in dubai ( united arab emirate ) . i was formerly living in cuba and served under castro ` s government but had to run into self exile after the ruling government of fidel castro closed in on my family on accusations of anti - government statements , i was once married with two children but my family could not escape before the deadly hands of castro ` s goons fell on them . l did made a lot of money serving castro and on getting to uae , i have been a merchant here in dubai dealing in ornamentals , oriental carpets and artifacts and life was very smooth for me until about three ( 3 ) years ago when i was first diagnosed of cancer of the larynx . before this happened my business and concern for making money was all i lived for , i never really cared about other values in life . but since the loss of my family and hometown , i have found a new desire to assist helpless families . i have been helping orphans in orphanage / motherless homes . i have once donated some money to orphans in war ravaged eritrea , somalia , sudan and some east european countries . before i became ill , i kept $ 4 . 5 million in a long - term deposit vault of a security / finance company and i didn ` t state any next of kin when the money was deposited and if i died without stating any the money will automatically go into the coffers of the security company and i don ` t want this to happen . i have left the hospital and presently receiving treatment in an acupuncture clinic , i have been undergoing treatment for oesophageal cancer at the hospital . i have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that i have only a few months to live . it is my last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations . because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my illness , i cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them . please , i beg you in the name of god to help me collect the deposit and distribute it amongst charity organizations . use your judgement to distribute the money and feel free to reimburse yourself when you have the money for any cost you incur during the process of collecting and distributing the money to charity organizations . i am going to send you vital documents to back my claims and i am willing to offer you a reward if you are willing to help , please reply as soon as you can on my alternate email address : ( josemartinez @ starmail . com ) . looking forward to hearing from you soonest . regards , j . a martinez get tiscali broadband from £ 15 : 99",1

Incredible, but true.  Web forms can &gt; also accept /multiple/ or even /free-form/ telephone numbers and can &gt; even be partitioned into manageable steps. All this can also be done &gt; without selling exclusive rights to your wallet to the World&#x27;s &gt; Second-Richest Corporation (assuming Cisco is still #1) and vendor &gt; locking your business into their &quot;small transaction fee&quot; tithe. Ah, but you&#x27;ve just gotten to the crux of the situation.  There&#x27;s good design and bad design.  There&#x27;s good testing and bad testing.  The problem is, anyone can design a good Web form, but nobody does.  I think &quot;best practices&quot; hasn&#x27;t caught up on main street Web enablement yet.  There&#x27;s some really great packages on how to do this stuff and in fact the usability people knew that Web forms needed to be fixed 5 years ago, so that&#x27;s why we got XForms and  XHTML.  You can shoot yourself in the foot and people usually do.  What the problem is, they don&#x27;t even recognize that they&#x27;re gimpy--ever.  They just keeping trundling along making a mess of everything assured in their job security that they can build Web forms without even caring if they can be used or not beyond their test machine.If you had a piece of software and a security warning came out 5 years ago on it, would you run that software? Wouldn&#x27;t you have patched or upgraded something so fundamentally broken 4 years and 11 months ago?  What I want to know is why would someone use Web forms best practices from 5 years ago?  I mean you can get a college degree in that time.  Imagine if the next version of Microsoft Windows or Red Hat Linux forced you to use a tiled window manager?  Sure, tiled windows were the best we had for a brief period of time, but they are completely useless except for some terminal based replacement applications. The bottom line is, if you can&#x27;t get across the bridge, then it&#x27;s broken regardless of whose fault it really is, and it&#x27;s the business that  needs to take responsibility as they are the ones that wanted to put the bridge there in the first place.

" &quot;Kerry Nice&quot; said:&gt; What about some reality check rules.  Yeah, you can pack in lots of things &gt; into the header to try and get some negative points, but do they all make &gt; sense in combination.  Can you have a Pine message id in the same header &gt; with an Outlook Express one or a Mutt User-Agent?Yes, this is a big bonus of meta rules (new in 2.40); we can now e.g. check for an Outlook-style forwarded message, and not give it negative points unless it contains other signs of being from Outlook.&gt; I think the headers should be paid special attention to.  The message &gt; content of something from the NY Times or Lockergnome might look spammy, but &gt; usually they don&#x27;t forge or fake anything in the header.  Tone down the &gt; negative scores and ding them extra for any obvious forgeries.When we get more (good) &quot;nice&quot; tests, the GA will assign lower scores to them.  I think the current problem is that there are very few really good nice tests in the current rulebase, and lots of +ve tests that those newsletters hit, giving the GA a big problem to solve.--j. ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same old cell phone?

"foreign language in commercials content - length : 1937 greetings ! i &#x27; m wondering if someone out there can identify the languages used in two recent ibm commercials . they have out a series of three ads with people in different countries talking about ibm equipment and services . one ad has two old gentlemen walking along what looks like the seine , speaking french . a second ad has two men sitting in what is apparently a middle eastern marketplace , and a third ad has nuns discussing ibm equipment on their way to mass . i assume the men are speaking arabic ( though i would be grateful to have that confirmed ) , but i have no idea what the nuns are speaking . anyone know ? i would also like to take this opportunity to thank all those who responded to my questions early last year about some french , italian and swedish expressions in some print ads . i meant to send individual thanks , but i lost the file in which i had the respondents ! please forgive me , and accept this general acknowledgment instead . if any of you who did respond would like to know more about what we did with your input , i would be glad to send you more information ( even the paper we wrote , if you want ) . thanks very much , mary ellen renryder @ idbsu . idbsu . edu",0
