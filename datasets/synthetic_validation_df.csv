We've discontinued the use of Outlook in our workplace due to the numerous vulnerabilities and exploits that it poses to our corporate network and data. Our concern is that even a single exploited system can put our entire network, customer systems, company reputation, and proprietary data at risk. Moreover, we can't rely on users to use Outlook in a safe manner, making it a liability from an employer's perspective.

Regarding custom sequences files, I'm not familiar with their use. It seems that custom sequences can help maintain indices, but I'm not sure how to make indices with them or keep them up to date. Perhaps a cron job could be used to maintain the sequences.

One feature that we miss in Outlook is support for S/MIME. We're currently running exmh on a remote machine, which has weak mime handling due to the lack of support for S/MIME.

You may recall that the Peruvian government planned to instruct state bodies to explore the use of open source software as a cost-saving measure, switching away from Microsoft licenses.

In essence, the article reports on the Peruvian government's efforts to reduce its software costs by adopting open source alternatives. The initiative is part of a broader effort to increase transparency and accountability in government spending.

I thought this development was worth sharing, given the ongoing discussion about the benefits and drawbacks of open source software in our community.",0

"The book ""Summary Justice: Judges Address Juries"" by Paul Robertshaw, published by Cassell as part of the Open Linguistics series, offers a comprehensive analysis of the practice of judicial summing-up to juries in England and Wales. This study examines the transcripts of these summings-up, which can vary in length from a few to hundreds of pages, and are significant in breaking the flow between advocates' turn-taking, especially their final speeches, and the deliberation of the jury. The book considers this practice as a legal problem, unrecognized advocacy, and examines alternative models, such as those in the US, Canada, and Scotland. In particular, the Scottish model is recommended for consideration by Anglo-Welsh judges, with its emphasis on parsimonious reference to the disputed narrative, only where relevant to the legal issues on which instruction is being given.",0
"The recent query and summary by Larry Trask on German affricates got me thinking about the distinction between one-segment and two-segment stop-fricative sequences. Unless I'm mistaken, it's possible to perceive this difference in certain cases. For instance, Polish has a contrast between initial clusters and affricates, where words like ""trzy"" and ""czy"" differ only in the presence of a cluster versus an affricate.

Moreover, when comparing the English pronunciation of ""ts"" with the German pronunciation of ""z"" (or Polish, Yiddish, etc.), there's a noticeable difference. English speakers may render ""matzah"" (or ""matzoh"") with a different sound than Yiddish or Polish speakers. Interestingly, I've found a few English speakers who pronounce ""matzah"" with an affricate, /ts/, in some Yiddish borrowings, but not in others, which affects their rhyming abilities. Additionally, some speakers may have a one-segment /ts/ in phrases like ""hit ya"" but a two-segment /t/+/s/ in ""hits ya"".",0

Dear All,

I am writing to inform you that we experienced an outage on EnronOnline on August 9, 2001, which resulted in slow message delivery and trading suspensions. The issue was caused by a bug in the firmware on a single disk in our storage system, which responded slowly but did not fail over as expected.

At 8:40 am, we started noticing delivery slowdowns, and by 8:50 am, updates were so slow that we had to suspend all trading products. We brought the site offline at 8:56 am to prevent any further issues. By 9:10 am, we isolated the problem to a single disk and removed it from the configuration, bringing the database back online by 9:28 am.

During the time the site was down, we experienced issues with another brick of storage, which we had to take offline again at 11:17 am. After verifying that there was no data corruption or loss, we brought the site back online by 11:56 am.

I want to assure you that we have already received a patch from the disk vendor and will be applying it to all our storage systems, one brick at a time, starting tonight.

I'd like to reiterate the importance of considering historical context when discussing complex issues. The phrase ""let's you and him fight"" is a metaphorical way to describe a strategy for managing troublesome populations by relocating them to a shared area, with the intention of minimizing conflicts with the dominant group.

In the context of Ireland, this means relocating Scots, who are seen as barbaric and prone to uprisings, alongside the Irish, also known as ""uppity barbarians"" with a penchant for ""risings."" This approach would allow for the troubles to be managed more effectively.

In contrast, Israel is an example of ex-Ottomans and Zionists, both considered ""uppity barbarians,"" being relocated together. This approach would also allow for the troubles to be managed more effectively.

On the other hand, India is a unique case, where the partitioning of Muslims and Hindus was a result of their own conflicts, rather than English resettlement policy. Similarly, in Canada, the French and English had already established themselves, and it was the balance of power on the continent that determined the events in the colonies.

It's essential to acknowledge the complexities of historical events and avoid simplistic solutions. Instead, we should strive to understand the nuances and",0

"The email body could be rewritten as follows:

I'd like to agree with Tom Craven's astute observation. It's intriguing to consider why the phrase ""could've"" expands to ""could of"" with emphasis on the second element, pronounced like ""of"" rather than ""have."" I wonder if the model of ""to"" is relevant here. Notice that ""to"" behaves like a preposition when used before a noun, but verb-like when used before an infinitive, as in ""it's important never to tell lies."" Additionally, ""to"" has two forms, weak and strong. Interestingly, you never find ""of"" used after a tensed verb, except in cases where it's used after modals, just like ""of"" in ""could of."" I'd like to point out that the ""of"" in ""could of"" cannot be the preposition ""of"" because the latter requires a complement, whereas the ""of"" after ""could of"" can be elided, as in ""I could of.""",0

"I recently attended a heart checkup and received mixed news. The treadmill test revealed that I was able to walk for seven minutes without any issues, which is a positive sign. Additionally, the ultrasound exam on my carotid arteries showed that they are clear and healthy, free of any plaque or disease.

However, the doctor also detected some problems with my heart. A portion of it is not functioning properly, and there are several reasons why this might be the case. Fortunately, the doctor assured me that this does not mean I will die sooner or that I need to significantly restrict my activities. Instead, I should continue to monitor my health and report any recurring symptoms. If necessary, we may perform an angiogram and possibly an angioplasty to address the issue. The good news is that the likelihood of needing another bypass surgery is relatively low.

"Thank you for sharing the interesting quotes with me. I particularly enjoyed the ones from Fred Allen and Charles Dickens. The phrases ""daughter artillery imitation is the sincerest form of television"" and ""he would make a lovely corpse"" are quite thought-provoking and offer a unique perspective on human behavior.

I also found the quote ""you're never too old to become younger"" by Mae West inspiring. It's a reminder that we can always strive to improve and learn, regardless of our age. These quotes have given me much to think about, and I appreciate your willingness to share them with me.

"I believe it would be valuable to keep the DNSBL rule, even though it only achieves a hit rate of 0.77. The rule is still useful in reducing spam and should not be removed. Instead, we should focus on improving our handling of network service outages in SpamAssassin (or the libraries we use).

While it may be tempting to eliminate the rule due to its relatively low effectiveness, I think it's essential to recognize that the broken server and low hit rate are contributing factors, rather than the rule itself being ineffective. In my opinion, it's crucial to prioritize keeping the rule and continue to fine-tune it to optimize its performance.

I also want to note that the 0.77 hit rate is likely a conservative estimate. When analyzing trend data, I often use a combination of recent and historical data to determine the most accurate score. Given the current statistics, I predict that DNSBL rules will cluster more heavily around the 1.0 to 2.0 range once we implement the new GA.

Let's keep the rule and continue to work on enhancing our network service outage handling.",0

The author demonstrates that the class of K-valued grammars for K=1, 2, 3,..., is learnable both from structures and from strings, while the class of least-valued grammars and the class of least-cardinality grammars are learnable from structures.

In proving these learnable results, the author crucially uses a theorem on the concept of finite elasticity. The learning algorithms used in this work build on Buszkowski and Penn's algorithms for finding categorial grammars from input consisting of functor-argument structures.

The second publication is ""The Tbilisi Symposium on Logic, Language and Computation: Selected Papers"" edited by Jonathan Ginzburg from Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Zurab Khasidashvili from NTT Basic Research Labs in Japan, Carl Vogel from University",0
"The concept you're referring to is indeed diversity antenna, which utilizes multiple antennas to combine signals and improve the overall signal quality. However, using one omnidirectional antenna and one directional antenna in the dual antenna mounts may not be the most effective setup.

This is because the omnidirectional antenna is designed to receive signals from all directions, which can lead to interference and reduced signal strength. In contrast, a directional antenna is optimized for receiving signals from a specific direction, which can help reduce interference and increase signal strength.

By combining the two, you may end up with a signal that's not optimized for any particular direction, which can reduce the overall signal quality. A diversity antenna, on the other hand, is designed to switch between multiple antennas to maximize the signal strength and quality.

If you want to take advantage of the directional antenna's benefits, it's recommended to use a directional antenna for both receivers and transmitters, or to use a directional antenna in combination with a diversity antenna. This can help improve the signal quality and range.",0

If you didn't add it during compilation, there are two ways to check for Milter support in your sendmail configuration. One way is to grep your sendmail.cf file for the word Milter.

"Once upon a time, Roi mentioned that XMMS didn't work for him, and he used mpg123 instead. I think this is because Red Hat removed all mp3 support from version 8.0 due to patent and royalty issues. Fortunately, freshrpms.net offers the XMMS mp3 plugin, along with libmad, lame (mp3 encoder), and mpg321, which I used myself. Many other players, such as alsaplayer, xine, and mplayer, can also play mp3 files.

I appreciate your proposal and the confidence you have in me. However, I must express my reservations about the entire situation.

I also expect transparency and clarity throughout the process, including the ownership and legitimacy of the funds.

"As we continue to prioritize the security and privacy of our customers, we have made the decision to actively deny the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) from accessing our network's contents. This move is a direct response to the RIAA's recent announcement to access computers without consent, posing a risk to our customers' data and privacy.

"I'd like to shed some light on the controversy surrounding the role of tree lovers in contributing to uncontrollable forest fires. A Forest Service official has stated that the tree lovers' lawsuits have hindered efforts to address the issue by preventing the removal of dense tree stands and undergrowth. This, in turn, has led to an accumulation of flammable material, resulting in crown fires like the Cerro Grande fire.

It's essential to understand that these forest fires are not solely the result of Forest Service policies. The official acknowledged that the agency's ""10:00 A.M. policy"" has been a major factor in the buildup of vegetation over the years.

By preventing the implementation of projects aimed at clearing out dense forests, tree lover lawsuits are actually contributing to the problem they are trying to solve. This is a critical issue that needs to be addressed to prevent future devastating fires.

I'd like to emphasize that the Forest Service is not just a passive observer in this scenario. The agency has been hindered in its efforts to manage the forests effectively due to the lawsuits. It's crucial to find a balance between protecting the environment and ensuring public safety.",0

I recently had to wipe Linux from my PC, but forgot to restore the original MBR (NT). Is there a way to do this without installing another operating system? I've tried formatting the entire disk, but that didn't work.

The easy solution is to install another operating system, as it should overwrite the MBR. However, this might not be the desired outcome, as Microsoft's installers often overwrite the MBR without asking for permission.

If you need to restore the MBR without installing another OS, you can try using a bootable floppy disk with a Linux-based MBR restoration tool. These tools are available online and can help you recover your original MBR.

Alternatively, you can try using a Windows-based tool to restore the MBR. Microsoft's recovery console or a third-party tool like Easy Recovery can help you achieve this.

I hope this helps. If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.",0

I am writing to you on behalf of my friend, who asked me to verify the acceptability of certain sentences that use the construction ""had better"" with a subject. The sentences in question are: ""You had better not stay here tonight,"" ""You had not better stay here tonight,"" and ""You better had.""

The initial inquiry raised several points, including the acceptability of sentences with an inanimate subject, such as ""It had better not rain tomorrow or we can't go to the beach."" A summary of the results is presented below.

The results show that approximately two-thirds of the respondents rejected the usage of ""had better"" with an inanimate subject, and that this usage varies geometrically, especially in British English.

The examples provided in the email include sentences (4), (5), and (6), which demonstrate the use of ""had better"" with inanimate subjects. Sentence (6) in particular uses the phrase ""This had better be good"" to convey a sense of expectation or skepticism.

I have found that the 7.3 binary should work as long as you install the ""rpm404"" compatibility library.

We are excited to announce a new organizational change designed to better align our engineering and operations capabilities with the commercial businesses they support. Effective immediately, we are forming a new business unit, Enron Engineering and Operational Services (EEOS), which will combine our existing operations in Enron Engineering and Construction Company (EE&CC), Operational Energy Corporation (OEC), and National Energy Production Corporation (NEPCO).

Brian Stanley, as President and Chief Executive Officer, and Keith Dodson, as Chief Operating Officer, will lead this new organization, reporting to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services. NEPCO will continue to operate as a standalone business under John Gillis, President.

The majority of EE&CC and OEC's activities focus on assets and projects within Wholesale Services, aligning EEOS efforts with the commercial businesses it supports. EEOS will work closely with and have direct accountability to the business units it supports, centralizing our engineering and operations capabilities in a single segment.

This realignment will allow for the sharing and implementation of innovation and best practices across our operations, better identification of priorities, and more effective resource allocation.

"As I've been exploring the realm of mobile visual communications, I've come across claims that this technology will revolutionize the way humans connect. However, I find it challenging to grasp the significance of instantly sharing photos across distances.

I've discussed this with a colleague who shares your enthusiasm, but I remain unconvinced. What compelling reasons do you see behind the notion that picture-sharing will have a profound impact on human communication? I'm struggling to understand the transformative power of visual messaging, especially when considering the limited scenarios where it's truly essential.

Currently, I can easily send text messages to numerous contacts and occasionally share photos when necessary, like sharing a funny haircut moment. While this technology can be a nice-to-have, I'm having trouble grasping the ""must-have"" nature of this feature.

Hello Mr. or Madam,

I believe that people are resorting to shouting and screaming over political figures because they feel that it is the only means to be heard in a noisy and chaotic environment. It's as if they're saying that, unless they can engage in a public gathering or forum, they will not be able to express their opinions or sentiments. This raises questions about the importance of free speech and the ability to express oneself without being silenced or ignored.

In an ideal scenario, individuals would have the opportunity to engage in respectful dialogue and debate, free from intimidation or coercion. However, when circumstances make it difficult or impossible to be heard, people may resort to more aggressive methods to be heard. This can lead to situations where individuals feel compelled to scream or shout in order to be heard.

It's important to recognize that free speech is not a license to engage in any behavior, regardless of the circumstances. Rather, it's a fundamental right that should be exercised responsibly and respectfully. While it's true that individuals can choose to walk away from a situation that makes them uncomfortable, it's also important to acknowledge that people have the right to express their opinions and engage in public discourse without fear of retaliation or suppression.

I understand that some may argue that this type",0

Dear All,

I wanted to share an unsettling incident that occurred recently in San Francisco. Two individuals who were participating in an anti-war demonstration on Saturday critically injured themselves by sticking their heads through the roof of a former school bus as they were passing through the Broadway Tunnel. Unfortunately, both individuals died as a result of their actions.

I understand that this incident may seem tragic, but I couldn't help but find it somewhat ironic. As I was pointing out in my initial post, there is only one location in the entire city of San Francisco where individuals were advised to keep their heads inside - the Broadway Tunnel. Unfortunately, these two individuals did not heed this warning and suffered the consequences.

I must admit that I did find some humor in the situation, but I also acknowledge that this is not a laughing matter. Losing one's life is a grave tragedy, and I hope that this incident serves as a cautionary tale for others to follow safety guidelines.

"I am seeking research on nominal constructions in various languages where the noun phrase contains both a preposition and a postposition. A relevant example from Pashto grammar, as described by Herbert Penzl, is the construction ""we sarri te to man to,"" where a preposition is sometimes optional, while the postposition is obligatory. Since Pashto is a head-final language (with a typical word order of SOV), it is tempting to view the postposition as a straightforward case marker. However, there are certain binding facts that suggest a phrase with an NP and postposition is referential, which may allow us to analyze the postposition as a type of case marker. I am aware that there might be a distinction between homophonous case markers and postpositions in Japanese, for instance. I would greatly appreciate any recommendations for articles addressing these constructions. Additionally, if there are other linguists studying Pashto, I would be delighted to hear from you.

"As you may be aware, Boeing has recently issued a warning regarding potentially faulty fuel pumps that could compromise the safety of airline passengers. In light of this information, there is a growing demand for airlines to install fuel tank inerting systems. 

These systems work by replacing oxygen in the fuel tanks with an inert gas, which significantly reduces the risk of explosion. While the primary concern is ensuring the safety of passengers, it's essential for airlines to take proactive measures to mitigate potential risks. 

Boeing's warning emphasizes the urgency of addressing this issue, and we believe that fitting fuel tank inerting systems is a crucial step in ensuring the well-being of both passengers and crew. We urge all airlines to take this warning seriously and prioritize the installation of these systems as soon as possible.

As the chief accountant at a bank where a deceased individual, Mr. Gavin Norris, had a US $8.3 million account, I have been instructed by the bank's board of trustees to notify his next of kin.

I listened to Aaron Schwartz's interview on NPR's Weekend Edition, discussing Warchalking. While his squeaky voice was amusing, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of jealousy that he got to share his thoughts on the topic.

"I would like to bring to your attention an extraordinary article that I think you would find fascinating. According to the BBC News Scotland website, a team of archaeologists has made a remarkable discovery in the north-east of Scotland. Excavations at the Cawdor Castle have unearthed the remains of a previously unknown medieval chapel, complete with intricate stone carvings and artifacts. The finds suggest that the chapel was built in the 14th century and was in use until the 16th century.

The team, led by Dr. Elizabeth Miller, has been studying the site for over a year and has made several significant discoveries. The most notable find is a beautifully preserved stone effigy of a nobleman, believed to be the remains of Sir Alexander Sutherland, a prominent Scottish nobleman. The effigy is accompanied by a series of intricate carvings depicting scenes from everyday life in the 14th century.

The significance of this discovery cannot be overstated. It is a major breakthrough in our understanding of Scottish medieval history, providing a unique insight into the lives and culture of the period. I would recommend reading the full article to learn more about the discovery and its implications.",0

"I was wondering how I could repeat a string a certain number of times in bash or other Linux commands. For instance, I want to repeat the string `""> ""` three times. I've tried various methods, but I'm not quite getting the desired result.

I have the following code:
```
STRING="">""
NUMBER=3
PREFIX=""repeat $STRING $NUMBER""
echo $PREFIX
```
However, this only outputs the literal string ""repeat > 3"". I'm unsure how to achieve the repetition.

I've also tried using Perl:
```
STRING="">""
NUMBER=3
PREFIX=$(perl -e ""print \""$STRING\"" x $NUMBER;"")
echo $PREFIX
```
This does produce the desired output, but I was hoping for a more straightforward bash solution.

I've heard that the BSD utility `jot` can accomplish this, but I don't have access to it at the moment.

"Dear Jean, Jesus, Lisa, and John,

I would like to discuss our efforts to sell the Pluto gathering line to Duke. As previously decided during our internal meeting on Wednesday, I met with Stephen Noe over lunch to discuss Duke's evaluation based on the data provided. Enron has shared the gathering agreement with Duke, which contains the guaranteed revenue stream.

I questioned Stephen about Duke's evaluation and informed him that Enron would like to know a notional type value for the Pluto gathering line. We both recognized that the value would be highly dependent upon the discount factor being applied to the revenue stream. Stephen stated that Duke's evaluation to date shows a value in the $14 to $15 million range, but management had not reviewed it. However, based on the notional value Duke has derived, it appears that Duke is using a discount factor similar to the one Enron is using.

I recommended that we proceed with setting up a Mariner meeting to review the geophysical data and begin seeking Marathon approval for the Production Handling Agreement (PHA). I will contact Richard Clark regarding the PHA. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me at ext. 33541.

"Around the world, there's a growing concern that profit-driven motives are draining the meaning from people's lives. It's astonishing to see how corporations prioritize profits over people's well-being. The concept of democracy is often reduced to a hollow shell, with key principles such as morality, responsibility, and social responsibility being ignored.

Take, for instance, the rise of ""me-first"" capitalism, where companies focus solely on maximizing profits, disregarding the negative consequences. This trend is exacerbated by the commodification of public services, healthcare, and education. The once-honorable principles of democracy, as envisioned by Thomas Jefferson and others, are slowly being eroded.

As we look around, we see how Spain, for instance, prioritizes its citizens' well-being, offering longer vacation leaves and a more comprehensive social safety net. Meanwhile, our own country seems to be moving further away from those same principles.

It's crucial for us to question the true meaning of democracy and whether our system is genuinely serving the people. Instead, it seems to prioritize the interests of corporations and the wealthy. As we continue down this path, we risk losing the essence of democracy.",0

Dear [Recipient],

I am writing to provide you with a summary of the current situation regarding California's budget and energy settlements. As you may be aware, the state's budget has been resolved, with a tentative reserve amount established by the California legislators. Both sides are reportedly uneasy with the $2.74 billion compromise, and the four Republican votes needed to pass the budget in the Assembly are likely more obtainable than the one Republican vote needed in the Senate.

Additionally, California's current redistricting process may provide Republicans with future seats that could translate into immediate bargaining power in energy and budget matters. Furthermore, consumer activist Harvey Rosenfield plans to pressure State Treasurer Angelides into battling with legislators for progress on the budget and revenue bonds.

On the energy front, negotiations between California state energy officials and the large energy providers have opened with the FERC-appointed Administrative Law Judge, Curtis Wagener. The results from the 5-day negotiations will significantly influence the state's efforts in promoting a Plan B or MOU. Burton indicated that FERC would need to order between $3 and $4 billion in generator refunds before the state would finalize a SoCal bail-out. However, without substantial contributions from power providers that sold into California and currently fall outside FERC's jurisdiction (",0

While it's clear that the number of sexual partners and acts can be equal between males and females, I'd like to clarify the concept of promiscuity. In its common meaning, promiscuity refers to activity above a specific threshold or norm, which is inherently a description of distributions rather than averages.

To illustrate this point, let's consider a population of 3 males and 3 females. Suppose three pairings occur, resulting in each person having sex once. Then, one of the males has sex with the other two females, while all other pairings remain. In this scenario, the average number of sex acts and sex partners is equal between the sexes. However, a greater number of women (2 out of 3) are above the single partner threshold and the overall average of 1.67 acts/partners. Additionally, more women (2 out of 3) are above the overall median and mode of 1.5 and 1 acts/partners, respectively.

In this hypothetical population, females are more ""promiscuous"" than males unless we redefine the term to be meaningless. This example highlights the difference between averages and distributions, and how the concept of promiscuity can be misleading when applied in a simplistic or absolute sense.",0

I'd like to introduce our company, the best prescription generic meds 4 less, where we offer discounted prices on a wide range of medications. Our goal is to help patients save up to 90% on retail prices, making healthcare more affordable and accessible.

However, I'd like to take a moment to clarify the importance of not judging a book by its movie. This adage applies to more than just cinema; it's a reminder to look beyond surface-level appearances and consider the true value of something.

This is also a poignant reminder to ponder the ultimate question: ""Must all things at the last be swallowed up in death?"" This inquiry encourages us to reflect on the fleeting nature of life and the importance of cherishing each moment.

Finally, as they say, ""The time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining."" This phrase serves as a metaphor for taking care of the present, even when the future is uncertain. It's a call to action to address our current needs and priorities before circumstances become more challenging.

In conclusion, our company is dedicated to helping you find the best prescription generic meds 4 less, while also encouraging you to cultivate a deeper appreciation for life's precious moments. If you have any questions or would like to learn more",1

Dear valued recipient,

I am writing to introduce myself as Barrister Werner Johnson, a solicitor at law, and the personal attorney to the late Mr. Mark Michelle, a French national who used to work as a private contractor with Shell Petroleum Development Company in Saudi Arabia. Unfortunately, he and his family members lost their lives in an auto accident on April 21, 2001.

As his attorney, I have been trying to locate any of his extended relatives to notify them of his passing and to manage his estate. However, after extensive efforts, I have been unable to find any next of kin or beneficiaries.

In light of this, I am reaching out to you with a proposal. My client had a deposit valued at $11.5 million USD, which is currently held by a finance company. The company has notified me that if we do not provide his next of kin or beneficiary by the next sixty official working days, the account will be confiscated. Therefore, I am seeking your consent to present you as the next of kin/beneficiary to enable the proceeds to be paid to you.

I propose that we share the proceeds in the ratio of 60% to me and 40% to you. I have all necessary legal documents to support our claim",1

Please find below the rewritten email body, providing clarity while retaining the original meaning:

I would appreciate it if someone could provide information on the dependencies and prerequisites for installing on FreeBSD. The official documentation is not clear about these requirements, and I find it challenging to understand the setup process.

For instance, the documentation mentions procmail, but it does not specify whether it is essential or not. Furthermore, there is no information provided on whether GNUmake is required or if the standard BSD'make' is acceptable.

I thought that our project team was committed to providing clear documentation, including a README file. It would be helpful to have this information readily available.

Regarding procmail, it is essential if you are using SpamAssassin for local delivery, not using a milter, and not using a Mail::Audit script instead. So, it is likely that you would need it.

Additionally, BSD'make' is acceptable, as Perl usually uses it to build Perl modules. SpamAssassin is another Perl module that requires similar setup.

I have searched extensively but cannot find any relevant documentation, including a README file for SpamAssassin. Having procmail installed, I am struggling to comprehend the setup process. Any guidance on a ""simple English"" HOW-To would be greatly",0

I'm shocked by how little attention is being given to mobile visual communications, despite the significant impact they're already having. With the ability to instantly share photos across vast distances, I believe this technology will undergo a profound transformation in the way we communicate.

"Why am I so passionate about decentralization? I firmly believe that some of the most significant issues with modern networked applications stem from centralization. In essence, centralized systems allow only one answer to a question, whereas decentralization enables multiple agents to hold different opinions on the same matter.

In the context of software development, centralized variables can only contain a single valid value at any given time, restricting us to representing information according to the beliefs of a single authority, and changes that propagate slowly. However, centralization remains the foundation for popular network application architectures, such as client-server interaction using request-response protocols.

I believe these limitations are profound and are already being encountered in practice. For instance, spam is a matter of perspective, yet our email protocols and tools do not acknowledge the distinct interests of senders and receivers. Another example is slamming, which unfairly favors the bidder with the fastest connection to a centralized auction server. Sharing ad-hoc wireless networks is a third example of decentralized resource allocation.

Furthermore, the limitations induced by centralization will not improve as computing, storage, and communication costs continue to decrease. Instead, the speed of light and human independence represent fundamental limits to centralized information representation and, therefore, centralized software architecture.",0

"Dear [Recipient],

I'm seeking your assistance in finding high-quality software at an affordable price. I've come across a selection of programs that might be of interest to you: Windows XP Professional 2002 for $50, Adobe Photoshop 7.0 for $60, Microsoft Office XP Professional 2002 for $60, Corel Draw Graphics Suite 11 for $60, and several other options. These programs are all high-quality and would be valuable additions to your software collection.

On a separate note, I'd like to bring to your attention a situation that has arisen. Commander Farragut has found himself in a predicament while searching for a narwhal in the North Pacific Ocean. The crew of his vessel believes that the beast is avoiding continents and islands because it prefers the open water. However, this theory is being challenged by inquiries made in both the scientific and nautical communities.

I'd appreciate any assistance you can offer in resolving this matter. Your insights would be greatly valued.

"Hi team,

I wanted to bring a few important matters to your attention.

Firstly, Paul Johnson has confirmed that Monday night is fine for the dinner with Spyros.

Secondly, Lucy Deathridge from Risk called regarding the Boston conference. She needs your presentation by tonight so they can make copies. I informed her that you were unavailable and didn't know if your presentation was ready, so we can have 500 copies made from the copy center and overnight them to her next week. Your feedback on this is appreciated.

Lastly, I've been trying to arrange a meeting with Mike Roberts regarding e-online. He scheduled it for Friday at 11:30 am, but Mark Palmer, who will be here at the same time, knows nothing about the meeting. Unfortunately, I've been unable to reach Dan Diamond, who might have Mike's cell phone number. If you have Mike's cell phone, please let me know.

"Dear Louise,

Unfortunately, I was unable to attend our meeting this morning due to interviewing analyst candidates. However, from what I've gathered, the overall sentiment seems to be positive, and I commend you on setting a clear tone. Given the company's liquidity situation, I felt compelled to share a thought regarding a potential avenue for Power Origination to explore.

As most of our activities require capital, I was wondering if you consider a viable strategy to be flipping Carl Tricoli's prepaid concept for IPPs on its head. Instead, we could establish a reverse transaction with one or more counterparties, where we absorb the upfront premium and deliver power in the future. Assuming we can find the right counterparties, we would effectively achieve a short position, aligning with your strategic thinking, and generate immediate liquidity.

"Dear Mel Gorman,

Regarding your query about identifying the client causing the most NFS usage on the server-side, we can utilize various tools and commands to achieve this. One approach is to use the `nfsstat` command with the `-c` option, which will provide information about the client's connection. You can run the command `nfsstat -c | grep ""calls""` to get a list of clients and the number of NFS calls they made.

Additionally, you can use the `tcpdump` command to capture network traffic and analyze the packets to determine which client is generating the most traffic. This will require you to run a packet capture on the NFS server while it's experiencing high load.

On the client-side, to determine which process is causing the most NFS usage, you can use the `nfsstat` command with the `-m` option, which will provide information about the process ID and the number of NFS calls made by each process. You can run the command `nfsstat -m` to get a list of processes and the number of NFS calls they made.

I hope this information helps you in identifying the client and process causing the most NFS usage.

Recent findings from a survey conducted by Durex condoms revealed a surprising insight: 67% of women expressed dissatisfaction with the size of their partners. While size may not be everything, it can undoubtedly play a significant role in the pleasure and satisfaction of sexual encounters. The data suggests that larger genitalia can stimulate more nerve endings, providing a more enjoyable experience for both partners.

I would like to partner with someone who can assist me in transferring this money out of the financial institution, and I believe you would be the ideal partner.

As we explore new ways to age and lose weight, remarkable discoveries have been made about Human Growth Hormones (HGH). These findings are revolutionizing our understanding of aging and weight loss. By harnessing the power of HGH, you can lose weight, build lean muscle mass, and even reverse the visible signs of aging.

The benefits of HGH therapy extend beyond physical appearance. You can also expect improvements in libido, penile erection duration, bone health, memory, and even the appearance of your skin. Additionally, HGH therapy may promote hair growth and reduce wrinkles.

To learn more about these remarkable benefits and the science behind them, I invite you to visit our website and discover the facts for yourself.

We have finalized the revised amount for the purchase demand fee for Tenaska IV 10/00 as $2,405,706.43. Unfortunately, the volumes were not actualized correctly. 

We have reviewed the numbers and concluded that the larger of the two volumes is $1,395,000, which represents a demand rate of $45,000 per day. Our review of deal 514353 confirms that the demand rate is accurate.

However, we are experiencing an issue with the demand fee showing up with a January 2003 delivery date in settlements. We believe that the demand fee should only be allocated to October 1, not the current setup with a date range of October 1, 2000, to December 31, 2036. This discrepancy is likely causing confusion in the system.

"I'd like to clarify how to rebuild packages with specific options. When you rebuild a package with `rpmbuild --rebuild.src.rpm --with alsa`, you'll see the selected options and be informed if any dependencies are missing. For example, if you're enabling ALSA, you'll need the `alsa-lib-devel` package.

I also wanted to ask a question on the rpm-zzzlist: Would a new dependency of 250k, the `alsa-lib` package, be a problem for freshrpms.net users? I'd like to integrate ALSA into my system, especially after spending time recompiling the `alsa-kernel` package for various kernels. I'm willing to accommodate this change and give it my vote.

"Tomorrow, December 1, marks the last day to schedule December barrels, and we are currently short 1,220,000 barrels. Despite exhausting all measures of buying crude, including settling sales financially, buying from companies where we have short positions, and selling physical puts, we have reduced our short physical position from over 10 million barrels to 1.2 million barrels under extremely difficult credit terms.

We believe it is essential to prepay a counterparty to cover the remaining position, which would require a cash infusion of approximately $22,631,000 (1,220,000 x $18.55/barrel). Every effort will be made within the next 24 hours to reduce this position, but the outlook is not optimistic.

"I wanted to follow up on our meeting regarding the Charm product. I appreciated the feedback you provided, and I was wondering if your group would like to see any specific areas improved. Your comments during the meeting led me to believe that the main concern was whether Charm could effectively cover the complex risk areas your company is involved in. Would you mind if someone from the Charm team contacted you or Vince Kaminski at 713-853-3848 to gather more specific comments? 

I would be grateful if you could provide feedback on our meeting. We appreciated the interactive nature and the opportunity to discuss the product. Your input is essential in helping us develop Charm further. 

Please let me know if there's any additional information I can provide. The Charm team is committed to making the necessary improvements to ensure the product meets your needs.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.

"Dear Rohit, I've been following your story and I must say, I'm intrigued. I've been thinking that it would be great to organize a grassroots movement here on FoRK to show our support for you and help you find love. We could even create a personalized ad for you on Craigs's list, and the best one would win a dinner date with me! I know it's a long shot, but it would be a fun way to get the word out.

I've also been thinking that your current photo isn't doing you justice. It seems like the woman who posted her ad is someone you'd hit it off with, and you deserve the best. We could work together to create a new profile picture that showcases your dashing side.

Please let us know if you're interested in this idea, and we'll do our best to make it happen. Good luck with your search for love!

"As we navigate the post-9/11 world, Disney's theme park business is facing significant challenges. A potential war with Iraq could have a devastating impact on their profits. Despite their success in the past by aggressively adding new attractions and steadily raising admission prices, their strategy is now showing signs of wear.

According to David Koenig, a Disney historian and author, ""The strategy was build, build, build. Every year there was something new. It was an astounding growth period... Now they're overexposed."" The theme park operating income for Disney is expected to fall by 27% this year, with a projection of $1.16 billion. By 2003, this figure could rise to $1.49 billion, depending on the outcome of a potential war with Iraq.",0

We are pleased to announce the upcoming launch of the Bison Pipeline Project, a new 325-mile greenfield pipeline that will connect the rapidly growing Powder River Basin to the midcontinent gas grid. This project, proposed by Northern Border Pipeline, aims to provide a direct route for Powder River Basin gas producers to reach Midwest markets.

The pipeline will add a new route for between 375,000 and 500,000 MMBtu/d of production, starting in November 2003. The proposed connection will also provide access to several local distribution companies, including Montana-Dakota, Alliant Interstate Power, MidAmerican Energy, Nicor Gas, People Gas, and Nipsco, as well as interconnects with Northern Border's Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline's Baker Storage Field.

The projected recourse rate is 26 cents/Dth/D, but a negotiated 10-year demand rate can reduce this rate by 4 cents. The pipeline also offers ""mileage-sensitive rates,"" allowing shippers to tailor supply access and optimize transportation value.

To learn more about the project, we invite you to attend a briefing meeting in Denver on November 14. For more information, please contact Project Director Paul Miller in Omaha, NB, at (402) 398-7758",0

Dear All,
As we continue to optimize our natural gas origination business, we're making changes to enhance our organization and facilitate growth. To better serve our diverse customer base and focus on identifying and responding to their needs, we're consolidating our mid-market, origination, and wellhead pricing activity in the central and eastern gas regions under Fred LaGrasta, head of the derivatives group.

Meanwhile, the producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged, with Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively leading the effort. We're also creating a new Strategic Asset Development initiative, led by Laura Luce, which will focus on entering into long-term partnerships in the central and eastern regions. This effort will identify strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management, and optimization.

Frank Vickers will continue his role in the eastern region and assume leadership for mid-market and origination activity in the central region. The West and Texas origination groups, led by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond, will remain unchanged.

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura, and Frank in their new roles. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out.

I'm thrilled to share my amazing experience with your male enhancement formula. I used to feel self-conscious about my body, especially during childhood when I was embarrassed to shower with other boys. But, your system has not only increased the size of my manhood while erect but also boosted my size while flaccid. I feel more confident and like the man I was meant to be.

While Java may have improved in terms of performance, I still believe the difference between Java and C/C++ remains crucial. I'd like to highlight a specific scenario where Java's out-of-the-box parsing and transforming of XML data fell short. On the same hardware, a Java implementation took 25 times longer to process XML compared to a C++ implementation. This lag is further compounded when considering the increased parsing overhead due to byte-ordering and data passing.

This distinction is not only significant but also critical, especially when considering the demands of parsing engines. A 100x difference in processing times is not trivial and can have a substantial impact on overall system performance.

In conclusion, despite advancements in Java's performance, the differences between Java and C/C++ remain pertinent and worth considering.- Duncan Beberg",0

I'm excited to share with you some valuable insights on maintaining healthy living for everyday life. It's essential to focus on self-care and wellness to boost our overall well-being, which can also positively impact our sexual health. As the saying goes, ""wisdom is educated insolence"" - we must take responsibility for our actions and make conscious decisions that align with our values.

The phrase ""a wise man will make more opportunities than he finds"" resonates deeply with me. It highlights the importance of being proactive and embracing new experiences, rather than simply waiting for opportunities to come our way. By doing so, we can cultivate a sense of empowerment and confidence.

As we strive to be the best version of ourselves, I believe it's essential to treat others, especially animals, with kindness and compassion. The quote ""how you behave toward cats here below determines your status in heaven"" serves as a poignant reminder of the interconnectedness of our actions and their impact on our lives.

The Natural Gas Deal Structuring course is a hands-on program that builds on the knowledge gained in the Applied Energy Derivatives program. The focus is on deal structuring opportunities in the natural gas market, where participants will develop a deeper understanding of the economic relationships between physical operations and their financial counterparts.

The course is designed to identify marketing opportunities and provide insights into the cash liquidity risk of futures margin requirements, futures contract specifications, and hedging strategies. Participants will learn how to structure fixed-price hedges, consider cash-futures basis implications, compare futures and swaps, and recognize the advantages and risks of stack-and-roll hedges.

Additionally, the course covers time spreads as a risk and opportunity, swing swaps and options for short-term storage and transport risks, trading seasonal spreads and price curve shifts, and identifying embedded options in storage and transportation. Participants will also learn to recognize the optionality in pipeline capacity, utilize intentional imbalances to extract value, and sell or buy gas indexed to power or other energy prices.

By the end of this course, participants will be able to quantify cash liquidity risk, specify futures contracts, structure hedges, and make informed decisions regarding natural gas transactions. We expect participants to have basic knowledge of the gas industry and derivatives, and are excited",0

There's no standard way to retrieve this information, and even if available, it's not necessarily accessible. The `ls -lc` command can display this information, but parsing its output requires some effort. A more direct approach is to write a short C program that accesses the file's status directly and outputs the creation time in seconds since the epoch, which can be easily compared numerically.

Some systems have a `stat` tool that can be used with the `-t` option to achieve the desired result. For example, on a system with this tool, you can use the command `$ stat -t /etc/motd` to get the creation time. However, the format of the output is not explained in the man page, and the filename is printed as the first ""field,"" which can cause issues with simple scripts that handle bizarre filenames.",0

"Dear colleagues,

I have been intrigued by a frequently cited claim in formal grammatical literature: that since grammatical relations are derived, they cannot be referred to by the grammar. My puzzlement lies not in whether grammatical relations are primitive or derived, nor in the grammar's ability to refer to them. Rather, I am concerned about the alleged causal relationship between these two questions. Specifically, I am puzzled by why some scholars believe that the derived nature of grammatical relations necessarily means they cannot be referred to by the grammar.

To illustrate this point, consider a parallel instance: control (c-control, etc.) is a derived concept, yet it can be referred to by the grammar. This suggests that the supposed link between derived status and inaccessibility to the grammar may be overstated. I would appreciate any insights on this issue and would be grateful for any enlightenment you can provide.

"This study explores the link between sociolinguistics and mediated discourse as social interaction. The research, led by Ron Scollon, a professor at the City University of Hong Kong, presents an integrated theory that brings together the latest research in media studies and social interactionalist discursive research. The book critiques the traditional sender-receiver model in media studies and advocates for an analysis of media discourse as social interaction among journalists, newsmakers, readers, and viewers. The study is based on ethnographic and textual analysis of print and television news media and offers a coherent and interdiscursive methodology for examining the role of the news media in the social construction of identity. The book is recommended for advanced undergraduates and postgraduates studying media studies, sociology of language, discourse analysis, interactional sociolinguistics, ethnography of communication, and applied linguistics.",0

I wanted to recap the next steps regarding the HPL balancing, as I had to leave the meeting early and you were not present at that time. To confirm, Ed Gottlob, Melissa Graves, Rita Wynne, and Clem Cernosek will work together to pull data from HPLC's total transport business and balance it with the off-system interconnect business used in the Texas trading operation. This perspective should result in the accounting UA 4 numbers recorded each month in our general ledger.

As the core team, they will focus on this task and enlist others as needed, potentially including Gas Accounting, Settlements (Lisa Csikos), or others. Johnnie has also offered assistance from her team, but believes that tying the data is best done through Energy Operations. They will need to determine their course of action and schedule a follow-up meeting with the group once they have some data to share.

I want to emphasize the importance of this project and the need for everyone to take ownership of the results. The four team members will dedicate their full attention to this project and will remove themselves from their daily activities to achieve the desired results.

Dear Group,

Please disregard my previous email regarding the revised real-time generation plan for Saturday, June 9. Due to changes in the schedule, we have revised our plan for submitting supplemental bids for our generators.

Effective Saturday, June 9, we will only submit supplemental bids for the generators if a Stage 1 emergency is called. This decision is based on ISO's ability to ramp the units up and down every 10 minutes. We want to ensure that we don't give ISO the ability to do so unless there is a Stage 1, 2, or 3 emergency.

Instead, we recommend selling the generators' excess available output as an SC to SC trade. Below, you'll find the preschedule, MW available, minimum price threshold, and unit ID information for each generator.

Also attached is a sheet with contact names and phone numbers for each generator. Please save it and reference it when dealing with the generators.

Specific details for each generator are as follows:

* Harbor: No action required, as they are down for maintenance on Saturday.
* Delano: Pandol 6 units, 15 MW available, 30 MW prescheduled, total output equals 45, HEL-24, Saturday, for $40. SC trade:",0

"I hope this email finds you well. I was excited to share some news with you. I recently discovered a new anime series that I think you'll find fascinating. The show features adult themes, intense animation, and compelling storylines that explore complex issues. The characters are well-developed and relatable, with both male and female protagonists navigating challenging situations. The animation is striking, with vibrant colors and dynamic action sequences.

The show's creators tackled thought-provoking topics, including social justice, identity, and relationships. The characters' interactions are nuanced, and the storylines are engaging and suspenseful.

"Regarding the costless collar for Hanover, I wanted to bring to your attention that Ryan and I have reviewed the research model and made some adjustments. Using the treasury rate on December 28, 2000, and the maturity date on June 30, 2003, we have calculated the ceiling to be 92.103/256 and the floor to be 34.7/8. After adjusting the research model, we arrived at a similar range, and we are confident in these numbers.

Additionally, we have attached an updated valuation from Bob Lee in research, using the actual 3-year historical volatility of 47.2, which results in a call strike of 97.978. Bob has also confirmed that the presence of the swap has no impact on the value of the collar.

"Yes, that was the plan, and I'm the only one consistently fighting against the evil forces of spam. However, there's an easier way to deal with email encryption. You can use STARTTLS, which is a more secure method of encrypting email communications.

You can search for more information on this topic by visiting the Google search page at [www.google.com](http://www.google.com). Simply type in ""STARTTLS"" in the search bar and you'll find plenty of information on the topic.

Keep in mind that while STARTTLS is not foolproof, it's a more advanced method of encryption that requires a higher level of capability to manipulate. This makes it easier to detect if someone is trying to intercept your email communications.

Hi Chris,

I would like to reiterate the importance of accurately crediting individual contributions to the West Power Middle Market and West Power Services originations schedule. Please ensure that the dollars are distributed fairly to recognize the efforts of each contributor.

Regarding the schedule, I would like to draw your attention to the Services Desk P&L, which is the responsibility of Greg Wolfe, a leading originator for the coverage group. The attached table summarizes the total contributions from both groups.

Additionally, I would like to highlight the importance of measuring coverage metrics, such as the number of transactions, counter parties, and EOL clients brought in. These metrics can be used to quantify the coverage performance of the Middle Market group and other non-commercial contributors.

It would be beneficial to begin collecting and analyzing this data to include it in the overall originations schedule for all ENA Middle Market groups. Perhaps other non-Middle Market origination groups can also measure similar metrics.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

I am writing to seek your assistance in a matter of significant importance. As the second son of the late President Laurent Desire Kabila, I am reaching out to you through the commercial attachÃ© of your country's embassy in South Africa, with whom I have established a trusted relationship.

Due to my close relationship with my father during his presidency, I had the opportunity to manage his personal security vault and confidential savings. Following his assassination, my family has concluded that his assets and properties, valued at millions of US dollars, should be relocated to a safe and stable country. We have arranged to transfer this sum through a diplomatic courier service to a finance and security company in London, and we are seeking your assistance in receiving this amount on our behalf.

As we, the family members, are restricted by the code of conduct introduced by my father to prevent embezzlement and siphoning of government funds, we cannot carry out this task ourselves. We require someone who can represent our interests in London, clear the funds upon arrival, and receive the payment of US$42M into their bank account. In recognition of your efforts, we are willing to offer you a 20% commission, with the remaining 80% being reclaimed by the family.

"Dear [Recipient],

In a shocking turn of events, the recently fired head of the UK's regulatory body has publicly accused her predecessor of exerted unbearable pressure. This scandalous accusation follows a series of controversial decisions and an intense media scrutiny, ultimately leading to the new head's departure.

"Well, there's a clever piece of code in MhSeqExpand that needs attention. Specifically, the `foreach` loop that weeds out sequence numbers for non-existent messages.

This code snippet is quite slow if a sequence starts with multiple missing messages, which could happen. The requirement to ensure the first message in the sequence exists, but not necessarily the others, seems counterintuitive. However, I'm glad it's implemented, as MhSeqExpand is called frequently, and verifying every file in the sequences would be impractical.

I think it would be beneficial to maintain a list of valid message numbers for the current folder, which would need to be periodically verified against directory changes. As for your question, Tcl does have a directory read function.

Mh_Sequence also rereads the relevant files (.mh_sequences and the context file), but I'm not clear on how often this is called. I'll look into it and share my findings once I'm back from my trip.

Since SoCal won't confirm during the typical cycle, the gas will be incremental, and supplies may not be scheduled.

We also need to determine if SoCal will provide a window like they do at SoCal Needles.

"This email is announcing the availability of two linguistic books for review by the linguistics community. The KPelle Dictionary, prepared by Elizabeth Winkler and a native speaker of the language, provides a comprehensive guide to the spoken language of Bong County, Liberia. The dictionary includes phonetic transcriptions of over 1,100 entries and comments on the sound system and grammar of KPelle.

Additionally, Ncholas Kibre's Phonology book examines the phenomenon of initial consonant mutation in Welsh, arguing that mutation is part of the phonological representation of morphemes. The analysis provides a mixed model that offers advantages over the traditional generative approach.

Linguists interested in reviewing either book should contact Andrew Carnie, PhD, at carnie@linguistlist.org. Please provide a brief statement about your research interests, background, and affiliation, as well as a surface mail address for the book to be sent to.

"Dear Colleagues,

I would like to request an urgent meeting to discuss our capital allocation strategy. With our counterparties growing increasingly nervous, we are facing challenges in securing credit and are being forced to prepay extensively to maintain business operations in the US and UK. It is essential that we address this issue promptly.

To mitigate these risks, I propose two possible solutions: (1) allocate a proportion of our available liquidity to each business, or (2) designate a point of contact to make decisions regarding large cash requests. For instance, EG&M seeks to send $200-$300 million for 60 days to purchase physical goods to cover an option with Koch. Given our limited liquidity, we must address this issue quickly.

I will endeavour to schedule a meeting for tomorrow to discuss this matter further. Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.

"Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to you with great distress and frustration. As the wife of the late Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, I have been subject to extreme mental and physical anguish since his passing. The current leadership of the Palestinian Liberation Organization and the new Prime Minister have been relentless in their efforts to torment me, even resorting to physical and psychological torture.

I have been accused of possessing funds in my husband's secret bank accounts and companies, allegedly totaling $6.5 billion. The government has been relentless in their pursuit of me, and I have been forced to hide the sum of $21 million with a security financial firm, pending a safe and secure opportunity for investment.

I am seeking your assistance in receiving this fund into your bank account, as I am no longer willing to trust the corrupt government. I propose that we discuss the terms of our agreement and the percentage share of the $21 million that will be placed in your care.

I'm writing to bring to your attention a recent development in the field of drug safety. According to a recent study, researchers have found that individuals who use a specific drug for only one night can be affected by its long-term consequences. This means that even short-term exposure to the drug can have significant implications for an individual's health.

While the findings of the study are alarming, other experts in the field have expressed scepticism about the results. They argue that the study's methodology is flawed, and that the conclusion drawn from the data is overstated.

As you consider the algorithms used to calculate confidence values, I believe it's crucial to recognize that revoking spam that everyone else considers as spam will likely incur a significant penalty. This may seem counterintuitive, as revoking spam would seem to indicate a more accurate assessment. However, the system may view this as an indication of a misaligned perspective, leading to a decrease in trust.

The issue arises when there are ""gray"" mails, where some people vote ""spam"" while others vote ""nonspam."" Under the proposed system, anyone who consistently votes ""gray"" mail as nonspam will likely accumulate a poor trust score. This could lead to an unfortunate scenario where even their own submissions are no longer considered in flagging their own spam. The confusion and frustration this might cause could be significant, with users asking, ""But I just marked that exact message as spam. Why is it not being considered spam? I'm an honest submitter.""

The degree to which trust is affected seems to depend on the proportion of reports versus revokes. If everyone except one person classifies a mail as spam, the lone dissenter will see a significant decrease in trust. Conversely, if you're part of the majority, your trust will increase. If there's a",0
"I am pleased to recommend ""Logical Relations in Chinese and the Theory of Grammar"" by C.T. James Huang, a seminal study in theoretical and Chinese syntax. This classic work has had a significant impact on recent developments in syntactic theory, exploring a wide range of topics such as phrase structure, quantifier scope, anaphora, movement constraints, and interrogative sentences. By analyzing a vast array of grammatical constructions in Chinese (and English), Huang sheds new light on the theory of universal grammar and linguistic typology, often revealing insights not readily apparent in the study of European languages.

Some of the notable findings include: a parametric theory of quantifier scope, a relativized notion of a ""governing category"" for Chomsky's Binding Theory, a theory of generalized control leading to the pro-drop parameter and related phenomena, a proposed condition on extraction domains (CED) for overt movement, and a proposal for LF wh-movement in languages without wh-movement. Additionally, Huang generalizes the ECP to account for subject/object asymmetries in syntactic and LF extraction.

"What's your take on Tibetan Buddhism, Justin? It's indeed remarkable to learn about their non-violent approach to dealing with conflicts. The story about wolves attacking their sheep is a great illustration of their principles. According to this story, when wolves attack, the Tibetans corral the wolf into a trap and then throw rocks from the surrounding cliffs to make it seem like the wolf was killed by someone other than themselves. This practice is reflective of their emphasis on minimizing harm and avoiding taking a life, even in self-defense.

It's also worth noting that in Samskar, the region had experienced a remarkable period of peace, with no recorded killings in over 2,000 years. Even disputes over resources, like a water hole, were resolved without resorting to violence. It's impressive to see how their philosophical approach to life has led to a culture of non-aggression.

Would love to hear your thoughts on this, Justin! Do you have any personal experiences or insights on Tibetan Buddhism that you'd like to share?",0

Regarding the implementation for FFVols, I would like to provide an update on the progress we've made. After analyzing historical and implied volatility calculations for Agg-Gas over a six-day period, we have observed a notable difference. Specifically, the historical volatility calculations have consistently been lower by approximately 17 mm, while the implied volatilities were significantly higher, anticipating stronger winter prices.

As a result, we have decided not to release the historical implementation into production at this time. Instead, we will maintain the official line with traders that the method is still under testing. The current historical variance is 19.2 mm, and the implied variance is 37 mm, effective from 09/25.

To address this discrepancy, we are continuing to test a hybrid methodology. This approach involves scaling historical vols by the ratio of prompt to historical-prompt volatilities. Tanya's analysis of a fictitious portfolio suggests that this hybrid approach generates higher variance numbers, but poorer backtesting compared to the historical approach.

Winston will begin testing using this hybrid vol method, and if the results are satisfactory, it will become the production methodology. We will ensure that all variance numbers are concurrently calculated to serve as indicators and risk beacons. Our goal is to",0

"Dear Vince,

I wanted to follow up on our previous discussion regarding the offer from Enron. As we previously agreed, I understand that it may be challenging for Enron to accommodate my desired starting date. I'd like to reiterate that I'm flexible and willing to work around Enron's needs.

To address the bonus situation, I'd like to propose two alternatives. Firstly, if Enron is willing to have me start immediately, I'd expect them to compensate for my missed bonus from Williams this year. However, considering we're already in October, I acknowledge this may not be a fair arrangement.

Alternatively, we could work out an offer now, and I'd start my new job after I receive my bonus from Williams, which should be in early February. This option suits me well, as Williams has had a good year, and I wouldn't mind delaying my start date.

Please note that I'm extremely interested in joining your group at Enron and am excited about this opportunity. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to me at 918-409-4308.

Regarding our campus recruiting strategy for next fall, I would like to inquire about the internship recruiting practices of companies that are our primary competition in this area, specifically the Big 5 accounting firms. It appears that these firms interview in May for a spring internship in the 4th year of their Professional Program in Accounting (PPA). We need to target 4th year PPAs in the fall before their spring internship or 3rd year PPAs in the spring. I would like to discuss and plan our approach for this between now and next fall. I am committed to interviewing for interns in both the spring and fall.

Dear colleagues,

I'd like to share a concerning development in one of our sci-fi authors' upcoming stories. They plan to incorporate a statement that could be perceived as insensitive, namely: ""The worst strategic mistake since the 911 attacks.""

When a client connects to the system, it initially appears as a single main process with one child process, corresponding to the heartbeat2 program. As the client sleeps for 5 seconds, a new child process (the client program) is spawned, along with another heartbeat2 process. At this point, the process list shows three processes.

However, when the client exits, the second child process (heartbeat2) fails to terminate, and instead remains active. This results in a rise in memory consumption, with approximately 8-9MB of memory allocated for each new client connection.

The issue is unclear, and it is not immediately apparent whether it is a C++ bug, a Linux bug, or a coding error. One possibility is that the thread manager created by the pthreads library is responsible for the extra process. This is normal behavior, as the thread manager is created only after the accept() function returns, and remains active to manage subsequent threads.

Additionally, it is possible that the stack for the extra threads is allocated from the heap, which may not be released back to the system. This could be due to the way glibc handles memory allocation and deallocation, which may not always release space to the heap.

It is unclear whether further investigation is necessary",0

As we continue to explore the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis in introductory linguistics, I am faced with updating my understanding of its current status. After extensive research and conversations with linguists, I would like to share my findings and seek your input on how to present this material fairly and accurately.

In recent years, I have been following the debate surrounding Whorf's mild version of linguistic relativity. While no one has disproved this theory, Pinker's book ""The Language Instinct"" presents a conflicting view, suggesting that Whorf was incorrect on all counts. This has led me to question what conclusion is now appropriate to draw in the context of linguistics.

Given the vast literature on the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis, I would like to summarize the current state of knowledge and invite feedback from those who have taught or researched this topic. I am interested in hearing your experiences and incorporating your insights into my presentation.

I was also struck by the emphasis on improving usability, particularly in systems like Plone and Xopus. It's clear that the concept of ""content management"" is often narrowly defined as web content management, with little attention paid to document management and the print/PDF dimension. I appreciated your candid remarks about the current state of tools, both open source and commercial, and your comment about the potential for commercial systems to scale well with large investments.

"I'd like to clarify a few points related to the argument against the food transaction model. In my neighborhood, the local McDonald's doesn't hand over drinks in the drive-through until cash is paid upfront, which may provide insight into the margin of survival in our region. I've never purchased a hot dog from a street vendor, and the thin margin may contribute to the slow adoption of modern, first-world patterns of constructive thinking.

I acknowledge that both sides were likely willing to be the aggressor, and I believe neither side should take that path. I'm disappointed that President Bush didn't forcefully condemn blind obedience to religion, particularly in the context of madrassa teachings or KKK ideology. His statement seemed carefully crafted to avoid scrutinizing religion in general.

It's essential to recognize that not all religions or expressions of faith are equal, and the US is trying to avoid making war on the Muslim faith. However, the US government remains committed to being multicultural.

As you're considering the use of base and delta images for automated recovery from attacks, I'd like to share my thoughts. I was inspired by a mode of operation supported by VMWare, where you can roll back state to recover from intrusions. I also explored this concept in my dissertation work on Optimistic Computing, which aimed to apply this idea to security problems.

However, I quickly discovered that it's not a straightforward approach. You need to consider when you can commit a state as being ""good"" without compromising performance and storage. This is because you can't run indefinitely from a redo log, and the penalties accumulate. You have to commit at some point, but if you commit too eagerly, you might commit corrupted state, and if you commit too conservatively, you'll eat into performance and storage.

Additionally, you need to address the issue of corrupted state in the middle of your redo log. You require a way to dig out the corruption and save the critical state that comes after it.

In response to these challenges, I proposed a less ambitious solution. Instead of committing state, you can simply revert to a base state on reboot. This approach is less resource-intensive and doesn't require the power of VMWare.

Dear valued investor,

Are you tired of the unpredictable and often manipulated performance of the stock market? Are you looking for a stable investment that can provide a consistent 25% to 35% tax-free annual cash flow return? If you answered ""yes"" to these questions, I have an exciting opportunity for you.

I represent a company with a limited offering of emerging growth Caribbean real estate, which includes a tropical working farm that generates substantial cash flow, long-term wealth accumulation, and proven appreciation. The farm is situated on a 20-acre tract of waterfront property in a tax-advantaged country, available for $106,000 (including closing costs and dual residency status).

The investment is a total turnkey system, where we handle all aspects of the farm, from planting and maintaining the crops to harvesting and providing quarterly cash returns. We currently have several tracts remaining in Phase II, which offer stunning views of an eco-resort's natural marina. With incredible demand for these tracts, I wanted to offer you the first opportunity to participate in this exciting project.

I invite you to review our online presentation, and I can connect you with the project's principals to answer any questions you may have. Please contact me as soon as possible to secure your spot",1

This special issue of Linguistics Volume 36, Number 4 presents a collection of articles that explore the development of the verb category from a cross-linguistic perspective. The issue is edited by Elena V.M. Lieven, and it features contributions from renowned scholars in the field.

The introduction, written by Shanley Allen, sets the stage for the subsequent articles, which examine the verb category in different languages. Heike Behrens' article investigates the learning of causative verbs in Inuktitut, while Penelope Brown's study looks at the difficulty of complex verbs in German, Dutch, and English.

Soonja Choi's contribution focuses on the emergence of the verb category in early lexical and syntactic development in Korean, and Katherine Demuth's article explores the relationship between argument structure and the acquisition of Sesotho applicatives. Michael Maratsos' article compares different models of the development of the English verb category.

The special issue concludes with a commentary section, which provides a comprehensive overview of the topics discussed in the preceding articles.

We hope that this special issue will contribute to a deeper understanding of the verb category and its development across languages.

it seems to me that many people share the belief that one cannot demonstrate the relationship between a group of languages by presenting systematic sound correspondences in their vocabularies, but rather must show systematic similarities in their morphological paradigms. however, my experience with languages from vanuatu suggests that morphological paradigms are the least stable features, followed by phonology, and then lexical features are the most stable.

i think there may be a historical reason for this reliance on morphology. perhaps it stems from the development of the comparative method on indo-european languages, particularly the discovery of sanskrit. it is possible that members of this language family have been particularly retentive in their morphology, leading to a generalization that morphology is a reliable criterion for all languages.

it is also easier to measure and compare lexical similarity, making claims based on such measurements more susceptible to scrutiny and refutation. however, how do you measure morphological similarity, or systematic similarities in morphological paradigms? these claims are hardly open to refutation.

i must admit that i have reservations about comparative linguistics. many of its methodologies seem ad hoc and lack a solid foundation, often relying on a misunderstanding of the underlying processes. the same claims and methods keep resurfacing",0

I am writing to clarify the status of the Napoleonville land transaction. As you may be aware, we did not acquire the land on Friday evening due to an issue with the chain of title. Enron only has records going back to our acquisition of the land, but we have since determined that we need to obtain additional documentation from the courthouse.

In light of this, we will not be providing environmental indemnification for the potential risks associated with the land. It is our expectation that the buyer would have conducted due diligence over the weekend to address this concern. Nevertheless, we are still committed to moving forward with the sale and exploring opportunities with either Texas Brine or Reliant.

Hi there,

As I reflect on my experiences and the stories I've heard from friends and acquaintances, I've come to realize that there are certain fundamental truths about dating that, in my opinion, everybody should know. It's not about finding the perfect match or trying to fit into societal norms. Instead, it's about understanding what truly matters in a relationship and embracing the uncertainties and challenges that come with it.

First and foremost, it's essential to understand that nobody is perfect, and nobody will ever meet all your expectations. It's unrealistic to think that you'll find someone who checks every box on your list. What's more important is finding someone who is genuinely interested in getting to know you, and who is willing to work through the tough times together.

Another crucial aspect of dating is the importance of communication. It's easy to get caught up in the initial excitement and forget to discuss important issues, such as goals, values, and expectations. This can lead to misunderstandings and hurt feelings down the line. It's crucial to prioritize open and honest communication to avoid these pitfalls.

Lastly, I believe that patience and understanding are vital in the dating process. It's tempting to rush into things or try to control the situation, but this can often lead to",1

By acquiring this empirical evidence, we can address several questions, including:
* How effective were Enron managers in removing lower-tiered employees?
* Did lower-tiered performers reallocate themselves to other business units?
* Have Enron managers successfully retained top performers from the 2000 PRC process?

* For individuals rated satisfactory and below, what have been their performance ratings in the past?
* How many superior or excellent candidates have left over the past five years?

"I am writing to express my disappointment with the recent software recommendation made by our IT department. Specifically, I am concerned about the decision to recommend Office XP as the standard office suite for our organization. After conducting research, I found that this software is no longer supported by the manufacturer, which poses significant security risks for our company.

I understand that the recommended price of $60 may seem reasonable, but I believe it is important to prioritize the safety and integrity of our data over short-term cost savings. I would like to request a re-evaluation of the software options to ensure that we are choosing a solution that meets our current needs and minimizes potential security threats.

I would appreciate it if you could also consider the reliability and user-friendliness of the recommended software. Our staff is already struggling with the complex interface, and I fear that adopting a technology that is no longer supported will only exacerbate this issue.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this matter and hope that we can work together to find a better solution.",1

"I recently read an article about Microsoft's new initiatives, and I have to admit that I'm not particularly enthusiastic about what I've seen so far. While I understand the company is trying to innovate and stay competitive, I just don't feel like they're making significant strides.

As a long-time fan of the company, I'm starting to feel a little disconnected from the Microsoft I once admired. Their recent moves seem more focused on trying to catch up with others rather than pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

I know that Microsoft is still a major player in the tech industry, and their decisions will undoubtedly have a significant impact. However, for me, their latest efforts just don't seem to be generating the excitement and innovation that I once associated with the company.

The annual conference of the German Linguistic Society for Data Processing (GLDV) will take place from March 30th to 31st, 1995, at the University of Regensburg. The conference aims to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the GLDV's founding, when it was initially established as the LDV-Fittings. The society's initial goals were to promote the development of linguistic data processing, particularly through the exchange of EDV-knowledge and programs.

Over the past two decades, the computer linguistic field has evolved, and the GLDV has become a professional organization for computer linguists. The conference will serve as an opportunity to reflect critically on whether the goals set at the time were reasonable, whether they were achieved, and what revisions are necessary and desirable.

The conference will feature a podium discussion with founding members to discuss this critical review and develop perspectives for future work. The second focus of the conference will be on applied computer linguistics. The conference will explore the significance of NLP systems in the context of graphical and multimedia applications.

"I wanted to bring to your attention a balancing issue with King Ranch, specifically related to the saxet canales production we are buying at the inlet. After speaking with Carol, she informed me that our average daily production for January has been around 3,850 DTH. This level has been maintained since November. Unfortunately, we don't have direct access to meter readings, but Carol has been brought online and will provide regular updates to help us balance our redeliveries. Our scheduling levels have been between 838 and 1,045 DTH per day at the meter. To ensure we accurately capture our volumes and avoid additional balancing issues with the plant, we need to gross up for January.

Dear Rejean and Simon,

I'm seeking your expertise in French grammar, specifically in the placement of adverbs like ""clairement"" (clearly) in sentences. I've noticed that in English, we can distinguish two different placements of adverbs with different readings.

Consider the example: ""The conflict is not clearly an international problem."" Here, the phrase can have either the meaning ""whether it is an international problem or not is not clear"" or the more straightforward ""the conflict is not an international problem.""

I'd like to know if the same distinction can be made in French. In the sentence ""Le conflit n'est clairement pas un problÃ¨me international,"" do we get the meaning of (1), (2), or both? Are there other possible placements of ""_clairement_"" that would yield a different meaning?

Rejean, I noticed your comment that sentence (3) indeed has the meaning (2), not (1), when ""clairement"" follows ""pas."" If ""clairement"" is placed before ""pas,"" does the meaning shift to (1)?

I appreciate your insight and look forward to hearing from you.

Contrary to the widespread notion that marriage benefits men's mental well-being more than women's, a recent study has revealed that both genders receive a similar mental health boost from matrimony. This finding challenges the long-held assumption that the stress and responsibilities associated with marriage, such as providing for a family, disproportionately affect men's mental health.

The study, published on [URL], highlights the importance of considering marital status as a factor in assessing an individual's mental health, rather than solely relying on gender. The researchers emphasize that both men and women can benefit from the companionship, emotional support, and sense of security provided by marriage, which can have a positive impact on mental health.

The study's findings should encourage individuals to reevaluate their perception of marriage as a solely male-oriented institution. Instead, it suggests that marriage can be a valuable tool for promoting mental well-being for both men and women, regardless of gender. This conclusion has significant implications for mental health professionals, policymakers, and the general public, underscoring the need to adopt a more inclusive and nuanced understanding of marriage and its effects on mental health.

By recognizing the mental health benefits of marriage for women, we can work towards a more balanced and accurate representation of the institution. This can ultimately lead to",0

Dear friend,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to you with a deep sense of humility and urgency, hoping you will consider my plea. My name is JosÃ© A. MartÃ­nez, and I am a 64-year-old Cuban man currently residing in Dubai. I served under Fidel Castro's government but was forced to flee Cuba after my family was targeted on false accusations. I had to leave behind my family, including my wife and two children, who were brutally murdered by Castro's goons.

Since then, I have made a significant amount of money as a merchant in Dubai, dealing in ornamental goods, carpets, and artifacts. However, three years ago, I was diagnosed with cancer of the larynx and my priorities shifted. Before this, I only cared about wealth and material possessions, but after losing my family and homeland, I developed a new desire to help those in need.

I have been assisting orphans in various orphanages and motherless homes, including in war-torn countries like Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan, and Eastern Europe. I have also donated some of my wealth to these causes. However, I have not stated a next of kin for a significant sum of $4.5 million, which",1

I'd like to ask you a question about your sexual experiences. When you engage in intimate activities, do you typically ejaculate before or within a few minutes of penetration? Premature ejaculation, also known as PE, is a common issue where one experiences ejaculation too quickly, often without control. This can impact the sexual pleasure of both partners involved.

PE can lead to feelings of guilt, embarrassment, frustration, and depression.

The essence of an extraordinary connection lies in embracing the imperfections of those around us, much like how old friends are incomplete without their quirks. Similarly, a book's lack of structure can make the reader's discovery a captivating experience. When it comes to relationships, we often fear that which we're not familiar with, as evidenced by the way women might fear receiving and men fear giving. On the other hand, it's crucial to recognize that our deepest sorrows can stem from excessive joy.

A true friend is a second self, someone we can be ourselves around. However, we often struggle with conformity, which can be a major obstacle to personal growth. The brave individual prioritizes others' needs above their own. Although our intellects can be impressive tools, we mustn't take ourselves too seriously.

When engaging in conversations with women, it's essential to remember that winning an argument can be a loss in itself. Moreover, if we can't find another way to receive a compliment, we should give ourselves one. In an ideal world, we'd focus on the evolution of knowledge, rather than trying to make outdated information mandatory.

The way we dress and the liberties we take with our attire are often influenced by societal norms, which can be limiting. Language",1

"We are bringing to attention a critical issue regarding the efficacy of government employee screenings aimed at detecting spies. A recent report by an esteemed panel of scientists has exposed that the testing process in place is not only ineffective but also a waste of valuable resources.

The scientists assert that the current methods employed by the government are flawed and do not provide a reliable means of identifying potential security threats. This lack of effectiveness puts national security at risk, as harmful individuals may go undetected.

Furthermore, the scientists' findings suggest that the testing procedures are often subjective, relying on intuition rather than objective criteria. This raises significant concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the results.

It is imperative that the government takes immediate action to revamp the screening process, adopting a more scientific and objective approach. This would not only ensure the detection of potential spies but also restore public trust in the government's efforts to protect national security.

We urge policymakers to heed the warnings of these renowned scientists and work towards implementing a more effective and efficient system. The national security of our country depends on it.",0

My motivation for this inquiry is to verify whether Middle Chinese had a four-way contrast between these on-glides. I have some reservations about the possibility of this contrast and would like to consult with experts working on other language families before drawing any conclusions.

To clarify, the notation in square brackets represents phonetic transcriptions, not phonemic ones. Therefore, [kj] should not be interpreted as a palatal affricate.

"Dear Tom,

I'd like to address the issue that affected our gubernatorial primary results. As you know, six districts that were previously sued in 2000 experienced technical difficulties once again, which led to the outcome being contested by Reno.

In light of this situation, I proposed an unconventional solution to Jeb via email. I suggested hosting a run-off party, where we would hang a papier-mÃ¢chÃ© donkey and a papier-mÃ¢chÃ© elephant. The first person to successfully bat open the papier-mÃ¢chÃ© figure would win. I believe this lighthearted approach could help mitigate the tension and bring the candidates together.

By the way, I came across an article that might interest you. It's about a situation involving Jeb's daughter, Noelle Bush, where a rock of crack cocaine was found in her shoe at a rehabilitation center. According to the article, the witnesses refused to give sworn statements, which led to the incident being investigated.

Let's discuss this further and come up with a plan to address the primary results.

Thanks for your email. I understand your concerns about the level of annoyance caused by the automatic insertion of strings like f70539bb32961f3d7dba42a9c51442c1218a9100 in messages. I agree that this can be frustrating, especially when it doesn't add any value.

You also mentioned the idea of using a program that makes every spam message display the recipient as the ""from"" address. I think this could be a simpler solution, as you don't need to manually add anyone to a whitelist.

I've also noticed that people tend to ignore messages asking them to apply for a whitelist. It's clear that this process isn't enjoyable for many users.

As for the addressbook feature in email programs, I tend to agree that it's not necessary. I only use it to lookup names or addresses of people I forget. This has helped me avoid sending viruses to others.

I understand your point about multiple email addresses, and how they can be a pain to keep track of. It's clear that many people have multiple addresses for various reasons.

As developers, we often find ourselves in a situation where there's no time to focus on learning and growing. With numerous projects and deadlines to meet, it's easy to get caught up in the rush and neglect our own education. However, I believe that the pursuit of knowledge and understanding is crucial to creating innovative and effective solutions.

In the article ""What to Do About RSS"" by Dave Winer, he highlights the importance of simplicity in the development of new technologies. According to Winer, RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is about simplicity, not just about syndication. This concept resonates with me, as I believe that simplicity is the key to building user-friendly and intuitive interfaces.

Winer's words of wisdom - ""In the overworked world of Web development, there's no time to study, there's only time to do"" - remind us that while time is limited, our focus should be on creating something worthwhile rather than simply completing tasks. By prioritizing simplicity, we can create solutions that are not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing.

As we strive to create innovative and effective solutions, it's essential to remember the importance of simplicity in our work. By focusing on the essence of what we're trying to achieve, we can build",0

Playboy magazine has launched a national campaign to feature Enron's female employees in an upcoming pictorial layout. The goal is to give these employees an opportunity to ""lead them down a new career path."" The layout is titled ""Women of Enron"" and is designed to give Enron's female employees an opportunity to be featured in a national publication.

According to Playboy's Photo Director, Gary Cole, the response to the campaign has been phenomenal, with a substantial number of interested women already responding. There is no limit to the number of Enron women who can be featured in the layout.

To be eligible, candidates must be at least 18 years old, be able to document their employment at Enron, and provide a valid birth certificate, photo ID, a recent photo in a two-piece swimsuit, and a head-and-shoulders portrait.

I am following up on our earlier discussions regarding the spring 2001 conference hosted by the Practitioner-Industry CEFER (Center for Energy Finance Education and Research).

"I understand that you're looking for guidance on optimizing packages for a Pentium system. You mentioned that some people suggested optimizing glibc and binutils, but it's important to note that these packages already determine the system they're compiling for and optimize themselves accordingly.

I'd like to clarify your question. You're asking why it's not recommended to optimize GCC itself, and what you can do to optimize its code generation. One approach is to optimize how GCC is compiled, which would only result in slightly faster code generation. However, since GCC is a memory-intensive program, it may be more beneficial to consider other solutions such as increasing RAM to improve file system cache hits and prevent GCC's heap from entering swap space.

The other option is to look into patches that affect GCC's code generation. However, I strongly advise against this approach, as compiler errors can be extremely difficult to trace and require a deep understanding of the code. It's essential to have a perfect, working compiler, and any modifications that might affect its performance are, in my opinion, unreasonable.

Additionally, I'm aware that GCC would need significant changes to achieve large speed boosts on x86 chips.",0

Dear Sir/Madam,

I'm excited to connect with you! As I often say, love has been the driving force behind many groundbreaking achievements. The simplicity and homeliness of nature are often overlooked, but they have the power to inspire and motivate. I believe that the future belongs to those who have faith in their dreams and the courage to pursue them.

When it comes to suggesting gifts, I think a monetary contribution is always appreciated and can be adapted to various individuals.

In life, we all face consequences, whether immediate or delayed. The power of love can mend a broken heart, but sometimes, we must be patient and learn from our mistakes.

In football, strategy is developed through thorough planning, and in politics, the search for solutions often begins in the midst of a campaign. The threat of injustice anywhere is a risk to justice everywhere. I believe that honest criticism, although difficult to hear, can be an invaluable learning experience.

Children can teach us many valuable lessons, such as the importance of patience. My ancestors may not have arrived on the Mayflower, but they were there to welcome those who did.

I wanted to reach out to you about a matter that has been on my mind lately. It's about finding a balance in our lives between being adventurous and being responsible. As you know, taking risks and trying new things can be exhilarating, but it's also important to be mindful of our well-being and the consequences of our actions.

I've been thinking a lot about this recently, and I've come to realize that it's okay to be a little reckless sometimes, as long as we're doing it in a way that respects ourselves and others. It's also important to remember that growth often occurs when we step out of our comfort zones and take calculated risks.

I've been reflecting on my own life and the choices I've made, and I've come to realize that being true to ourselves is what matters most. It's okay to make mistakes and learn from them, as long as we're willing to listen and adapt. And I believe that being kind and compassionate towards ourselves and others is essential in this process.

I would love to hear your thoughts on this and hear about your own experiences with taking risks and pushing boundaries. I know that we've all been in situations where we've had to make difficult choices, and I think that",1

To summarize our discussion on the subject of firewalls, I'd like to clarify the differences between FreeBSD's ipfw and the old OBSD firewalling code. While both are related, the new ipfw2 has been rolled into -STABLE, whereas the OBSD firewalling code was encumbered. My personal experience with netfilter/iptables on a few boxes has been mostly positive, with uptimes exceeding 60 days. However, this doesn't necessarily guarantee the absence of issues with the firewall code. I've found that having multiple boxes with Heartbeat setup can help mitigate potential problems. 

I understand your points about uptimes and the comparison to judging penis size. It's an interesting perspective, and one that highlights the importance of practicality in choosing a firewall. 

As someone with experience in both ipchains and ipfw, I agree that the learning curve for reading rules is quite different. Although this may not be a decisive factor in choosing a firewall, it can certainly influence one's preference as a beginner. 

Before we diverge too far from the topic, I'd like to confirm that the main differences between ipfw and netfilter/iptables lie in their syntax and availability. The choice between the two ultimately depends on personal preference and practical",0
"If your husband is experiencing pain or discomfort, I understand that you may be struggling to cope with his suffering. It's essential to prioritize his well-being and take steps to alleviate his pain, if possible.

Considering the information you've provided, I would recommend consulting a medical professional to determine the root cause of his pain and receive guidance on suitable treatments. In the meantime, you may want to explore relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, or gentle stretches, to help manage stress and anxiety.

Please remember that it's crucial to take care of yourself during this challenging time, too. Reach out to friends, family, or a support group for emotional support. Remember to take breaks, engage in activities that bring you joy, and prioritize self-care.

Remember to keep a journal or log to track your husband's symptoms, treatment, and any progress made. This will help you stay organized and provide valuable insights for medical professionals.

I hope you're doing well. I think you may have meant to refer to the ""Price Process Parameter Estimator"" rather than ""Price Process Parameter Esimator."" If so, I'm looking for the file ""97 Trend.xlsm"" located at ""O:\Research\Exotica\Prices\Reversion"" on your system.

Dear Eugen,

While our modern ideas about relationships may have led to shorter-lived relationships and dysfunctional families, it's essential to consider the perspective of traditional cultures. I agree that it's crucial not to blindly accept everything we read about the past. Instead, we should examine the statistics and data available on historical divorce rates.

It's true that traditional cultures, such as those in 18th century England or 20th century Saudi Arabia, may have had different family structures. However, it's difficult to make definitive claims about the ""functionality"" of their children without more information.

Regarding demographics and sustainability, I understand your concerns. However, I'd like to challenge your assertion that the West is suffering from lack of innovation. In recent years, I've seen numerous signs of innovation, particularly among youth in nations like Iran, who are drawn to America and adopting Western values.

The second generation of the Iranian revolution, for instance, is more Western-oriented, and the third generation is reportedly eager to move to the United States or adopt American customs. This shift is significant, as it indicates a desire for change and a willingness to adopt new ideas.

I'd love to discuss this topic further and gather more data to support or refute our claims. Perhaps we can explore",0

Following our discussions with the commercial group, it has become clear that setting a minimum NPV is difficult due to the complexity of James' chart. As we discussed, we will discuss the terms with individual shippers and provide them with a number. We will also use our chart as a reference point to ensure consistency in our evaluations.

To achieve this, we will reach out to shippers individually and discuss their needs regarding term. We will then use this information to provide a numerical evaluation for their bids. This approach will ensure fairness and consistency in our evaluations, and it will also enable us to create a paper trail that we can use to respond to any questions or concerns from BP.

"Dear fellow,
I'm writing to share a story about the dangers of using quack silver remedies to treat allergies. It seems that Stan Jones isn't the only person who has fallen prey to these unproven methods. A woman named ""Rosemary"" took silver supplements in the 1950s to alleviate her allergies, but the consequences were devastating. Her skin turned blue permanently, a constant reminder of the risks she took.

To warn others of the horrors she experienced, Rosemary created a website in 1998. Her story serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting the importance of seeking scientifically-backed treatment options for allergies. I urge anyone considering the use of silver remedies to read her story and think twice before making such a decision.

Make sure you are logged in as the root user and have navigated to the directory where you downloaded the file. You may encounter a few dependency issues, but you can obtain the necessary packages from freshrpms.net, with the exception of gcc3, which can be found on your Red Hat CD, the Red Hat FTP site, or rpmfind.net. 

After rebuilding the source RPM, the binary RPM should be installed in /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386. Once all dependencies are met, you can install mplayer by running the command ""rpm -ivh mplayer-20020106-fr1.rpm"" and you should be ready to go. Additionally, you will need the win32 codecs, which you can obtain from Google and place in the directory /usr/lib/win32. 

If you are still encountering errors, I suggest trying to rebuild the source RPM using the command ""rpm --rebuild mplayer-20020106-fr1.src.rpm"".

Meanwhile, amendments have been made to SB 78 XX, but the extent of these changes is not yet clear.

"Dear Sir/Madam,

I'd like to share an interesting phenomenon I came across recently. You know how some words have opposite meanings, but what's fascinating is when a word can be its own opposite. For example, ""outgoing"" and ""retiring"" are synonyms when referring to a person's social nature, but ""outgoing"" describes someone who is sociable and friendly, while ""retiring"" implies a sense of withdrawal and retirement. This concept is not unique to language, as scientists at IBM Research have discovered pairs of synonyms and antonyms that have this property.

Mary S. Neff, an IBM researcher, has been studying this phenomenon, and it's not just limited to language. In fact, many aspects of the world, like physical concepts or mathematical equations, can exhibit this property. It's mind-boggling to think about how words can have multiple meanings depending on the context, and how language is an ever-evolving, complex system.

I thought this topic was worth sharing with you, as it highlights the beauty and complexity of language. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this phenomenon and discuss it further.

For instance, instead of relying on a specific vendor, engineers can develop an input validator/parser on the backend to achieve this functionality. Designers, on the other hand, can utilize JavaScript libraries for some pre-validation. However, the primary concern is meeting functional specifications before focusing on non-essential details such as design elements, like colors and logos.

In the given scenario, the creative director's requirements were unclear, and the team was forced to accommodate the director's demands, which prioritized aesthetics over functionality. For instance, the director wanted the site to launch in a specific color scheme and with a zooming logo, despite the feasibility concerns raised by the engineer. Moreover, the director's insistence on meeting a tight launch deadline, which coincided with a press release about a strategic partnership with HypeCorp, led to a rushed solution.

In hindsight, the best approach would have been to focus on meeting functional specifications and validating user input, rather than prioritizing non-",0

As we continue to refine our psychoanalytical approach, I'd like to bring to your attention a few issues that arose during our recent study. Firstly, I noticed that our orthography may be having an unintended impact on our results. Specifically, the siphoniform ciboule in our study may be affecting the way we interpret the data. I recommend that we re-examine our methodology to ensure that our findings are accurate.

Additionally, I'd like to clarify that our recent observations suggest that the debye mayapples we studied may have been misinterpreted. The scattiest urinative pseudoviaduct we examined may have had an influence on our results. I propose that we conduct further research to confirm these findings.

I'd also like to point out that our use of ""postimperial pyrosises"" and ""tannings"" may be causing confusion. I suggest that we choose more straightforward language to convey our ideas. Finally, I'd like to request that we consider the implications of ""simianity viperous"" on our research.

I believe that by addressing these issues, we can ensure the integrity of our research and produce more accurate findings. I look forward to discussing these matters further with you and exploring ways to improve",1

I recently had the unique experience of manually entering a post into Radio, then extracting it using a batch file and UserTalk. I used Perl to parse the content, tidied it up with a C program I wrote, and transferred it to intertwingly via scp.

Hi Vince and Molly,

I've attached the resume of Howard Haughton, a candidate who is very interested in joining Enron. He is planning to travel to New York from the UK soon and has specifically requested that his profile be sent to Enron through our new relationship.

Howard has an impressive academic record, having earned a 4.0/4.0 grade point average in his last term at the University of Michigan. He is willing to do whatever it takes to intern at Enron from June to August and has included his picture with his resume.

I also attached the resumes of two of my students, Howard Lin and Sung. Howard will be graduating in May 2001, and Sung will be graduating in May 2002. Both students are my favorite interns, and I believe they can be cultivated to the Enron culture without incurring significant costs.

As their representative, I have agreed to take ownership of their future careers and will guide them through the graduate candidate process. I hope these attachments demonstrate my commitment to quality talent and my value to Enron.

Please feel free to contact Vince P., the headhunter, at (949) 813-2241 to arrange an interview if interested.

I'm writing to share some information on plant extracts and medications that have been developed to address specific issues. There's a new plant extract that has been found to treat depression in mothers by rendering preschoolers unconscious for up to six hours. Another extract has been discovered to eliminate melancholy in people by enhancing their memory of the hardships they experienced as teenagers.

Additionally, there are medications that can improve the lives of single women, commuters, and teenage girls. For instance, a liquid silicone can increase breast size and decrease intelligence when consumed before a night out, while a medication can increase life expectancy by controlling road rage.

Furthermore, there are antiboyotics that can improve grades in teenage girls and reduce the urge to spend money on makeup. Older women can benefit from a potent antiboyotic that increases resistance to pickup lines.

Lastly, there are injectable stimulants that can increase the potency and duration of spending sprees, and a medication that can relieve the headache caused by a forgetful man.

Dear friend,

I am writing to you in confidence, as a widow of the late President Mobutu Sese-seko of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Due to my current circumstances, I am seeking assistance in accessing my late husband's vast resources, which have been frozen by the new government.

"Dear Sir/Madam,

As we continue to navigate the digital landscape, it's essential to emphasize the importance of caution when making online transactions. Specifically, I'd like to highlight the risks associated with buying drugs online. It's crucial to exercise extreme vigilance and avoid engaging in such activities to ensure a safe and secure online experience.

Furthermore, I'd like to quote two influential statements. The first, ""the loftier the building, the deeper must the foundation be laid,"" serves as a reminder that a solid foundation is necessary for long-term success. This principle can be applied to various aspects of life, including personal and professional growth.

The second quote, ""be polite to all, but intimate with few,"" encourages us to maintain a delicate balance between being respectful and reserved. By cultivating meaningful relationships with a select few, we can foster deeper connections and build a stronger support network.

Lastly, I'd like to emphasize the importance of personal growth through self-discipline and self-control. By developing these essential qualities, we can develop greatness of character and become better versions of ourselves.

I hope you find these thoughts valuable and timely.

I'd like to share my thoughts on the feudal society that once existed in Tibet. While they ruled for a considerable period, I'm sure there were numerous challenges they faced. It's also important to note that not everyone in Tibet is as enthusiastic about the Dalai Lama as it seems in Hollywood. Moreover, the Chinese government has made significant progress in building infrastructure, which has led to the emergence of merchant classes and other economic developments that were previously non-existent under Tibetan rule.

"Hi Dave,

I'm not sure why the variable name needs to end with `[]` either. Typically, when working with submitted form data, we parse the data and extract the information into either variables or an array/hash. From there, we can name the variables whatever we like.

In PHP, if the query string contains `varname=FIRST&varname=SECOND`, it will create a variable called `varname` with a result of `SECOND`. However, if the query string contains `varname[]=FIRST&varname[]=SECOND`, it will create an array with `varname[1]` set to `FIRST` and `varname[2]` set to `SECOND`.

While there are other ways to get data from the HTTP request, I believe the method you described is the ""official"" way to retrieve data from a SELECT MULTIPLE using PHP.

One possible solution is to create a small Java bean application that runs as a normal user (not Tomcat) and has a default home directory or a secure location to store passwords and keys.

"Dear Sir/Madam,

I wanted to bring to your attention a recent development that I find quite amusing. News.com has published two articles on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and, in doing so, linked to decss.exe, a piece of code that was previously deemed too controversial. As a result, 2600 was banned, while other news services that originally linked to the code were not penalized. Slashdot, naturally, has picked up on this story and linked to News.com's articles.

I find this situation quite telling. It highlights the need for Congress and the courts to re-examine how laws like the DMCA are enforced. Unfortunately, it appears that these laws are often applied arbitrarily, relying on factors such as who you know, the perceived guilt of the defendant, and the level of attention given by the presiding judge. This has left me feeling disillusioned with the legal profession.

"I propose that instead of removing the specific rules, we comment out the lowest-scoring rules in the range. This would allow us to preserve the other entries while minimizing the impact of the ""noisy"" rules. However, before we proceed, I think we should investigate the low score for DATE_IN_PAST_48_96 to ensure it's not a false negative.

I agree that the rules FROM_MISSING, GAPPY_TEXT, INVALID_MSGID, MIME_NULL_BLOCK, and SUBJ_MISSING appear to be recoverable. It's likely that there are more rules that could be improved.

Regarding the proposed methodology, I suggest only creating a Bugzilla ticket for each rule if the community is comfortable with quickly closing WONTFIX tickets. Additionally, it would be helpful to include the statistics for each rule in the ticket, which could be automated using email.

Dear All,

I'm pleased to share my experience with an interesting South Bay Hi-Def party at my apartment in Sunnyvale on the Fourth of July. Unfortunately, it seems that the initial invitation I sent on June 30 was delayed and only delivered on July 9. Our mailman filters captured and quarantined two posts, including the invitation.

Despite my efforts to recalibrate my self-esteem, the event attendance was, shall we say, less than expected. As a humorous aside, I almost had as much alcohol on hand as George Washington did at his election celebration, which was a public festival day.

One attendee jokingly referred to the delayed invitation as a prize, and others reacted with frustration and disappointment. However, I'd like to remind everyone that the delay was not their fault, and we all must learn to be patient.

To share a lesson I learned from this experience, I must admit that SpamAssassin rated my original invitation as spam. It seems that using certain keywords, such as ""boob tube,"" can trigger annoyance in the Great American Shrine's filters. 

In conclusion, I hope we can all learn from my mistakes and appreciate the importance of timely communication. I look forward to seeing you at future events.

Best regards,

" Hi,

I'm looking for a command to insert my signature using a combination of keys instead of having to insert it manually before sending the email. One possible solution is to use component files in my mail component (nmh) to store my signature. This way, when editing a message, my signature is readily available. Additionally, using component files for specific folders, I can customize my signature for each folder. The nmh documentation provides more information on this.

It's also possible to use sedit to accomplish this, but I've been using gvim as my exmh message editor for a long time. I've set up a command to load email-specific settings, such as syntax highlighting for headers and quoted parts. I could potentially map some vim keys to add my signature or even provide a selection of signatures to choose from.

There are various ways to have randomly chosen signatures, and a good resource for this is the rtfm.mit.edu website, which has a FAQ on signature fingers (from May 1995).

Hope this helps.",0

Either SA is missing many spam messages or some people are intentionally sending all their spam to this list. I have recently submitted some spam emails that did not score highly, with scores below 5. I assume that most users run SA with a threshold of 5, and therefore, a rule needs to be developed to catch these messages.

"I understand your point about reconsidering guard conditions in while loops. However, I'd like to discuss the context around case statements. You mentioned that they can be cleaner than if statements, especially when dealing with multiple branches. I agree that case statements can be a good option in certain situations.

However, I'd like to challenge the idea that case statements are inherently cleaner. In fact, they can be more difficult to maintain and debug than if statements. This is because case statements can lead to a proliferation of code that becomes hard to follow.

Regarding the use of break inside a select statement, I agree that it's an essential part of the syntax. It's a control flow construct that allows us to exit the loop early, which can be useful in certain situations.

Overall, I think it's important to consider the specific use case and requirements before choosing between if statements and case statements. It's also important to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of each approach.

Thank you for your input, and I look forward to continuing this discussion.

I'd like to share some exciting news about the latest developments in memory technology. The integration of Rambus memory and a fast bus seems to be giving a significant boost to Intel's newest P4 processor. According to reports, we can expect a performance increase of 3-5% with the new PC1066 memory.

The new memory comes at a significantly higher price point - about 4 times more expensive than its predecessor. Nevertheless, the potential 5% speedup could make it an attractive option for those looking to upgrade.

In related news, there have been reports of a new GeForce 4600 graphics card, boasting a 20% faster performance than its predecessor. However, this comes at a double-edged cost, as it's significantly more expensive than the 4200.

"Dear colleagues,

I'm seeking guidance on the latest research in Transformational Grammar (TG), specifically in the areas of GB, P&P, and Minimalism, as it relates to subcategorization. I'd appreciate insights into how Minimalism differs from previous assumptions.

My primary concerns revolve around the nature of subcategorization relations and the types of phenomena they describe. For instance, transitive verbs seem to require a DP complement, but can a verb also accept a PP complement based on the head noun of the PP, as seen in examples like ""rely on""?

Furthermore, I'm interested in understanding the constraints on subcategorization relations. Which syntactic or semantic properties are thought to be accessible to the selecting head, and how do these constraints arise? Are there formal architectural constraints in the theory that dictate these constraints?

Your input on these questions would be greatly appreciated. Please feel free to share your thoughts and references.

"Dear fellow linguists,

I'd like to bring to your attention a recent review article published in the Journal of NIH Research (Vol 7, No. 1, January 1995, pp. 50-55). The article, titled ""Climbing the Family Tree: What Makes a Hominid a Hominid?"", discusses the linguistic abilities of Kanzi, an ape studied by Sue Savage-Rumbaugh and her colleagues.

In the article, the author, Pat Shipman, summarizes the work of Savage-Rumbaugh, who claims that Kanzi possesses a rudimentary grammar and can use displaced referents and arbitrary symbols, much like a 2-year-old child. Shipman also discusses the work of Derek Bickerton, who admits that Kanzi, along with other apes and young children, uses ""proto-language"" but not full language due to the lack of grammatical elements.

The article also touches on the topic of Broca's area and cortical specialization. If you're interested in the implications of this research for our understanding of language and its evolution, I encourage you to read the article.",0

"I'd be happy to modify the statement so that personal emails are not saved in the public spambayes repository. As an alternative, I suggest changing the code to set ""folder = None"", effectively preventing the email from being saved altogether.

Dear John,

I'd like to help you with your query about the strange compressed WAV files you've encountered on the Windows CD containing Beatles music. As you've discovered, these files are encoded in a way that's not compatible with most standard media players, including XMMS.

After conducting some research, I found that the files are likely encoded using Microsoft's ADPCM compression algorithm, which is a proprietary format. This might explain why some players, like Notun, crash when trying to play these files, and others, like Kwave, refuse to recognize them altogether.

Regarding your wish to split the tracks and convert them to MP3 for playback with XMMS, I recommend using a tool like Sox (Sound eXchange), which is a free, open-source audio file conversion tool. Sox can convert WAV files to MP3 and other formats. You can use Sox to split the tracks and convert them to MP3, making them compatible with XMMS.

Another option would be to use a tool like FFmpeg, which is a powerful, open-source multimedia processing tool. FFmpeg can convert WAV files to MP3, as well as perform other audio processing tasks.

Before using either of these tools, I recommend that you check the licenses and terms of use for",0

We invite applications for a three-quarter-time postdoctoral research position in the Language Production Research Unit at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, the Netherlands. The appointment will last three years.

As a postdoctoral researcher, you will contribute to our project on lexical access, which investigates the process of spoken word production from accessing a lexical concept to the initiation and execution of a word's articulation in context. Our project relies heavily on reaction time experimentation and computational modeling, with connections to brain imaging work in the institute.

We are seeking a candidate with a PhD in a relevant cognitive science (such as psycholinguistics, phonology, or phonetics) who has a strong background in reaction time experimentation and lexical/sub-lexical phonology.

Dear esteemed assistant,

I am writing to inform you of a confidential business proposal. As the branch manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria, Lagos branch, I have a unique opportunity to work with you.

A fixed deposit of $25 million, made by Mr. Barry Kelly, a foreign oil consultant, has been sitting in our bank since June 6, 1999. Due to his untimely death, the deposit's ownership has not been claimed. Nigerian law dictates that if the owner does not come forward within six years, the fund will revert to the government. To avoid this, I have sought the assistance of Global & Basic Financial Company to facilitate the transfer of the fund to Holland.

I require your cooperation to facilitate this transaction. As the owner of the fund, I will engage the services of an attorney to draft and notarize the necessary documents, obtaining a letter of probate and administration in your favor. Please note that this transaction will be entirely risk-free, as all paperwork will be handled by the attorney and my position as branch manager guarantees its success.

It seems you're questioning the relevance of the system's foundation in genealogical tracking to the discussion at hand.

"Under French law, the author of a work has the right to unilaterally modify the terms of the licence, as any granting of rights must be clearly specified and bounded by specific criteria. This is in contrast to the GPL and similar licences, which constitute permanent grants of rights tied to a specific instance of the work. The author may, however, issue additional instances under different licences, such as proprietary ones.

The notion that the author can change the licence arbitrarily stems from the lack of limitations specified in the original grant. Without such constraints, the author retains the right to rescind the licence and revert the work to a closed state at will.

Rick Moen's point, which emphasizes that this is not a sale but rather a grant of rights, is a crucial consideration in understanding the nature of the licence. Furthermore, the context is governed by contract law, rather than copyright law, as some attorneys have previously observed.

In this light, the analysis of the situation is rooted in the fundamental principles of contract law, and not merely a matter of copyright interpretation. Therefore, it is essential to appreciate the nuances of contract law when evaluating the flexibility of the licence.",0

Dear Sir/Madam,

I wanted to reach out to you about something unusual that has been on my mind lately. Have you ever noticed how, when we're feeling joyful, our creative spark is ignited? Like when we're walking down the street and suddenly we're drawn to the art installation on the moon-shaped walkway object? It's as if our joy is the catalyst for inspiration.

I've been reflecting on this concept and I'm finding it hard to put into words. It's like trying to draw a cold, energetic outline with a steady hand, while simultaneously being mindful of the dictionary definition of joy. Excitement is contagious, and I feel it would be beneficial to share this experience with others.

After all, isn't art at its core the expression of human emotion? People have a natural inclination to share their feelings through music, dance, and visual art. It seems like a point well-taken, that we're all on the same wavelength when it comes to creativity. If we can tap into that universal energy, we can grow as individuals and connect on a deeper level.

I'd love to discuss this further with you. Perhaps we could even schedule a visit to the art store and brainstorm some ideas? Would you be available to meet up soon",1

"When connecting to Pablo Software Solutions' FTP server version 1.0 build 9, it is possible to access files and directories outside the normal FTP root directory. This vulnerability was discovered on July 20th, 2002.

To exploit this vulnerability, you can use the MS-DOS ftp client to send a command such as ""dir \..\\"" or ""dir \..\WINNT"" when logged onto the server. This allows you to access files and directories outside the usual FTP root directory, for example, if your root directory is ""C:\ftp_server"", you can access ""C:\\"" or ""C:\WINNT"" using this command.

"And if a spammer forges headers, it's important to note that forging headers is relatively easy to detect. Instead, spammers often hide their originating IPs by sending emails through open proxy servers. In the past, spammers used open relay mail servers, but these often betrayed the originating IP, making them unattractive due to the proliferation of open relay blocklists and port 25 blocking by many ISPs.

Furthermore, combining a forged sender email address with mail sent through an anonymizing open proxy should be a strong indication of spam. Tracking a spammer's location to their physical address is not as challenging as you might think once you have legal recourse to subpoena records.",0

As part of this agreement, they have acquired an additional 14,000 mmbtu/day at a daily index price, which will generate incremental revenue of $209,720. Additionally, Sempra has negotiated a true daily firm contract for February 2001, purchasing 15,000 mmbtu/day at a higher window at SoCal, indexed to volume transported. We expect this volume to generate revenue exceeding $2 million.

To accommodate the new receipt point in the La Plata station yard, we are working with Operations and Facility Planning to coordinate the tie-in, which is scheduled to take place between April 2-5. We will provide necessary notification to Northwest Pipeline once planning notifies us of the estimated downtime and resulting cut in flows.

Our Westward expansion project has made significant progress, and we are finalizing project definition. We anticipate filing our FERC application in mid-February and have already received positive responses from interested parties.

El Paso Field Services has requested a meeting with our Operations team to discuss the necessary facilities to meet our specifications. We have identified the appropriate attendees and are scheduling the meeting.

I'd like to clarify the concept of terminal velocity in the context of air density. As we know, the terminal velocity is inversely proportional to the square root of air density. When air density drops, terminal velocity increases. To better understand this relationship, let's consider a different approach. Suppose we view the atmosphere as a system where gravity plays a dominant role, resulting in the potential energy of a mass M being directly proportional to its height h.

When two packets of air are in equilibrium, we can analyze their relative concentrations. If the packets are at the same height, the mass distribution will be equal, with half the mass in each packet. The flow of air between the packets will balance, resulting in equal amounts of air flowing from one to the other.

However, if the packets are at different heights, the flow of air will follow a different pattern. A greater percentage of the higher air will descend, while a lesser percentage of the lower air will ascend. To balance the flow, the higher packet must contain less air than the lower one. The mass balance of the flows will dictate that the high percentage of thin air is matched by the low percentage of dense air.

This concept is closely related to exponential decay in height, which theoretically compensates for the",0
"Dear Lola,

As discussed during our recent conversation, I wanted to follow up on the software requirements for credit modeling. During our conference call with the Enron research and credit groups in the US and UK, we agreed that we need specific software tools to develop the private firm models. After reviewing our needs, we have identified the following software packages that we will require:

1. EViews statistical package
2. SPSS statistical package (Please note that the UK office already has an SPSS site license, so this request is mainly for the US office.)
3. TOPS software
4. Neural Net software package (This package was developed by George in the UK.)

We would appreciate it if you could discuss and submit these requests to Craig Chaney for his approval. I would like to thank you for your attention to this matter.

I'm seeking clarification on the purpose of a delivery nomination for 1/99 production at receipt meter 98-9699. According to Anita, there is a delivery nomination of 22 at this meter, which seems unusual since it's a receipt meter. I've also noticed a similar situation at meter 98-2662. Clem Cernosek mentioned that these delivery nominations are causing errors on his end.

Can you please explain the purpose of these delivery nominations at these receipt meters? Additionally, since this activity is ongoing into 2/99, I'd appreciate any insight you can provide on what these volumes represent. I've been unable to recall the specific deal that led to this sale, but I believe it's valid and part of the purchase deal with Tesoro.

Jill Zively, George Weissman, and Melissa Graves may be able to provide further information, as they were involved in the deal. Anita, the allocator, may also be able to provide support for the allocation. If you have any updates, please let me know, as I'd hate to forget the details.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I wanted to clarify my previous email, as I've been worried that I may have said something that caused you to question Brendan's thoughts. When Brendan came in for a follow-up, I mentioned that I hadn't received an email from you. To be honest, I was a bit embarrassed, but I reassured him that I was working long hours that week and might have accidentally sent an early morning email that wasn't too significant. However, I'd like to clarify that I don't recall saying anything too out of the ordinary.

I am pleased to announce that we have successfully completed the 10-day parallel test milestone for FSP. The parallel test yielded solid performance for our key metrics, including template writing (1:30 - 2:30) and finals processing (5-7 minutes). Additionally, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that I owe $13.00 to Tim Belden, which I have since given to Debra.

Regarding next steps, I will be working with the DA and Real Time teams to ensure a smooth transition for the new system. We are also developing user documentation and cheat sheets to facilitate the transition.

In parallel production, we have begun using FSP to write templates and compare them to CAPS. This process has necessitated some changes to the existing ENPOWER-to-CAPS report, which we have already started modifying.

I anticipate that the user training will not take more than a week, but the production parallel may take a little longer. I am relying on the users to wrap up this task, and I appreciate Kysa Alport's willingness to volunteer for this duty. I spent a significant portion of today training her.

Lynne Hewitt and William Rapaport both recommended exploring the texts in ""Deixis in Narrative: A Cognitive Science Perspective"", which includes chapters on reduced anaphora in subjective contexts, unspeakable sentences, and empathy in syntax.

Anne Reboul provided information about her own work on the topic, focusing on personal pronouns, and suggested consulting CastaÃ±eda's work. Lynne also recommended BÃ¼hler's article on the deictic field of language and deictic words, as well as the books by Jerome Bruner and Kaete Hamburger.

I wanted to follow up on the discussions I had with Jim Hughes regarding the Westinghouse turbine. As previously discussed, I have consistently maintained that we would take the asset at cost, and their response has been that they intend to keep it. I would appreciate it if you could keep me updated on any further developments.

The original understanding was that the transfer price for the Westinghouse turbine was in Louise Kitchen's hands. It is my understanding that she will be back in the office next week, so hopefully, we can finalize this matter soon.

Please let me know if you have any updates or changes.

Best regards,

Speech Communication - Volume 14, No. 4 (September 1994)

This issue of Speech Communication features six articles from leading researchers in the field of speech processing and synthesis. In the first article, R. S. Waldstein and A. Boothroyd present their work on speechreading enhancement using a sinusoidal substitute for voice fundamental frequency. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in improving speechreading accuracy.

The second article, by S. Nakajima, focuses on automatic synthesis unit generation for English speech synthesis based on multi-layered context-oriented clustering. Nakajima's research explores the potential of machine learning techniques for improving the naturalness and intelligibility of synthesized speech.

In the third article, Z. S. Bond and T. J. Moore investigate the acoustic-phonetic characteristics of inadvertently clear speech. Their findings offer valuable insights into the properties of spoken language that are most important for speech recognition.

The fourth article, by Y. Qian et al., presents research on pseudo-multi-tap pitch filters in a low-bit-rate CELP speech coder. The authors demonstrate the potential of these filters for improving speech quality in low-bit-rate coding applications.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to you regarding a unique opportunity to assist in the transfer of a significant amount of funds. As a consulting auditor with Nedbank PLC in Johannesburg, South Africa, I have discovered an unclaimed account worth $25,400,000.00 USD, opened in 1998 by a deceased estate magnate. Due to the lack of a written or oral will, the account is at risk of being declared ""unclaimed"" and donated to a trust fund for arms/ammunition in Africa.

To prevent this, I have secretly discussed the matter with a close attorney confidant to produce legal documents substantiating the claims of next of kin and enabling a smooth transfer of the funds. I require a safe and reliable bank account for the transfer and a willing next of kin to stand in on behalf of the deceased.

I would like to propose a sharing ratio of 60% for myself, 35% for you, and 5% to cover expenses. To facilitate the transfer, I have secured an order of mandamus from the probate registry, making this business 100% risk-free and legal.

Kindly indicate your interest, and we will work together to transfer the funds to offshore clearing houses in Europe or Asia",1

"It's disheartening to note that people are becoming more aggressive and confrontational, especially in public debates. This development is alarming, as it's making it acceptable to interrupt and shout down others with different opinions.

I understand the sentiment that Americans are more prone to this behavior, but I believe it's not unique to the United States.

"Dear concerned citizens,

Recent reports suggest that Yahoo! has agreed to collaborate with the Chinese government in monitoring and restricting online content. This development raises serious concerns about the erosion of freedom of expression and the potential for self-censorship.

According to reports, Yahoo! has signed the ""Public Pledge on Self-discipline for China Internet Industry,"" promising to voluntarily investigate and report any content deemed ""subversive"" or ""harmful"" by the Chinese government. This pledge effectively turns Yahoo!'s Chinese portal into a tool for policing online users, rather than a platform for free expression.

Human Rights Watch has expressed deep concern about this development, warning that Yahoo! will become an ""agent of Chinese law enforcement"" if it implements the pledge. This not only undermines the autonomy of online users but also reinforces the Chinese government's grip on free speech.

We urge citizens to be aware of this development and to hold Yahoo! accountable for its actions. It is crucial that we stand together in defending the principles of freedom and human rights.

I am attaching the memoranda prepared by outside counsel regarding the BNYCP litigation. To facilitate understanding, I recommend reviewing the Andrews & Kurth memo first, followed by the Bernstein memo and the risk matrix last. All three assess that this case is fact-intensive and that limited factual discovery has taken place. Additionally, counsel has been restricted in its analysis due to confidentiality obligations.

While the analysis is largely based on available information, there appears to be consensus that, based on current facts and a preliminary analysis, the potential exposure ranges from approximately $20 to $50 million. Interest and attorney fees may also be significant.

"We have attached a spreadsheet outlining our rough calculation of the credit support value for MG and PaperCo. Our approach involves the following steps:

1. Modelling contracts as financial swaps.
2. Spreading notional trading volumes over estimated swap tenors.
3. Calculating the value of defaulting at each swap period using Black's formula.
4. Treating the default option value as risky cash flows, discounting back at both the original risky rate and the risk-reduced rate. The value of credit enhancement is then determined as the difference between the two net present values (NPVs).

We would appreciate any comments or feedback on this approach, particularly if you do not understand our methodology. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.

"I'd like to address a concern that has been raised about the use of GPL-licensed software. While it's understandable to be uneasy about the potential implications, it's essential to clarify the facts. Microsoft has been spreading misinformation, claiming that using GPL-licensed software, such as Linux, would require companies to make their entire intellectual property publicly available. This is a gross misrepresentation.

In reality, the GPL only applies to software that is modified and distributed. It does not affect a company's intellectual property or proprietary information. Microsoft has been using this fear-mongering tactic to create uncertainty and make it seem like using GPL-licensed software is risky.

I'd like to emphasize that this is not a Linux-specific issue. It's essential for business leaders to understand the actual implications of using open-source software and not let FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) cloud their judgment.",0

I would like to clarify my previous statement regarding the intentions of Vipul and his team. I apologize if my words came across as harsh or misleading. My intention was not to imply malice, but rather to express surprise and concern about the potential for unwitting test sites.

" Hi Jehan and Craig,

I think we're misunderstanding the purpose of Razor's algorithm. It's not about blocking spam messages or blocking specific keywords, but rather about identifying spam messages based on a user's existing opinion. The algorithm boosts trust by confirming a user's existing opinion, which is essential for effective spam filtering.

Craig, you mentioned that the biggest fallacy is that one needs to block specific spam messages to get a high trust rating. However, that's not the case. It's actually about confirming a user's existing opinion on a large number of messages, which doesn't necessarily involve blocking spam messages. This approach can lead to damping, which reduces the information in SpamNet.

Regarding your question about preventing people from exploiting this algorithm, I think it's crucial to note that the more someone submits and revokes messages, the less influence it has on their trust. This could be implemented by having an alarm trigger on the server when a user submits and revokes messages at a very high rate. This would prevent spammers from taking advantage of this algorithm.

As for creating a spamtrap, your idea of subscribing to legitimate nonspam mailing lists, spreading the email address, and receiving both spam and nonspam messages is a viable approach. By applying the algorithm",0

"A recent study by NewsIsFree.com suggests that individuals who switched from glasses to contact lenses experienced a significant rise in physical contact with the opposite sex. The survey found that individuals who wore glasses were more likely to shy away from physical contact, fearing embarrassment or rejection. In contrast, those who opted for contact lenses reported feeling more confident and comfortable in their physical interactions, leading to increased intimacy and connection.

The study proposes that the change in visual appearance plays a crucial role in this shift. With glasses, individuals may feel self-conscious about their appearance and subsequently hold back from physical contact. On the other hand, the comfort and ease of wearing contact lenses allowed participants to focus on building connections with others, rather than being held back by insecurities.

This finding has significant implications for individuals seeking to build stronger connections with others. The study highlights the importance of confidence and self-acceptance in physical interactions, suggesting that a simple change in appearance can have a profound impact on one's social and romantic life.",0

"I did not intend to downplay the significance of oppression in general. Instead, I'm suggesting that in examining linguistic patterns, it's less important to focus on the actual existence of oppression than on what people perceive it to be.

To clarify, I'm not dismissing the reality of oppression, which I believe is a pressing issue.

Dear valued customer,

We're excited to introduce Regalis (Super Viagra), a generic version of Cialis that contains the same active ingredient, Tadalafil 20mg. This revolutionary medication has been proven to help a large majority of men suffering from erectile dysfunction (ED) regain their sexual performance.

Regalis is often referred to as a ""Super Viagra"" or ""Weekend Viagra"" because its effects start sooner and last much longer than traditional ED medications. Many men who don't suffer from ED report that Regalis increases sexual pleasure and staying power, as well as enhancing the size and hardness of erections.

As Regalis is a generic version of Cialis, it's equally safe and effective for most men who are prescribed Cialis. The recommended dosage is 10mg, and each 20mg pill can be split in half. For patients with severe ED, a higher dose may be prescribed.

We ship Regalis worldwide, including Canada, Japan, the UK, and Australia. Our discreet packaging ensures that the contents are not visible, and our shipping typically takes 15-30 days to arrive.

Dear Sir/Madam,

As you may be aware, the federally mandated electric deregulation has opened up a huge opportunity for individuals to profit from the break-up of America's largest monopoly. With electricity deregulation, consumers can enjoy huge savings, while investors can reap massive profits.

The utility industry is a massive market, valued at 2.5 times that of the telecommunications industry. According to a report by USA Today (November 1997), Rep. Schaefer, Chairman of the House Energy and Power Sub-committee, estimates that as an owner of an electric company, you could realize an annual return of 50 to 100% on your investment.

Every time someone turns on the lights, you profit! This is a genuine business opportunity with real agreements, and not multi-level marketing or selling. You are being offered the chance to invest and reap the rewards by participating in the potential profits of an electric company.

This I.R.A. approved program is limited in its number of openings, and with an initial investment of several thousand dollars, you can potentially see your investment grow to $30-40-50,000 or more in the next few years, providing a lifetime income.

If you're interested in learning more about this outstanding opportunity, we invite you",1

Dear reader of Linguist,

Following up on our query last year, we have obtained Mary Ellen Ryder's dissertation ""Ordered Chaos: An Investigation of the Interpretation of English Noun-Noun Compounds"" and are considering implementing a PDP model like the one she introduces in her work. However, it appears that little has been done on this topic since then.

We are seeking general information on the following questions: 
- Do you know if Mary Ellen Ryder or anyone else has implemented a compound interpretation model, as she mentions in her thesis but does not provide results?
- If not, do you know of any other researchers working with PDP techniques, particularly focusing on implementing morphology?

I, Barrister Donald Williams, am the attorney to the late Denise Berkins, a foreigner and engineer with Atlas Engineering Consultancy, in the United Kingdom. Late Denise Berkins had an account with a UK bank since 1990, but due to his untimely death, there is no will to guide the management of the funds.

"As I delve into the fascinating topic of the software schism, I'd like to share an intriguing perspective on the Macintosh and DOS. Recently, I came across a thought-provoking passage by Umberto Eco, which compared the two operating systems to Catholicism and Protestantism. According to Eco, Macintosh is akin to the Jesuit path, emphasizing a structured and methodical approach to reach a desired outcome. In contrast, DOS is seen as Protestant, allowing for free interpretation of scripture and demanding personal decisions.

Eco further explores the concept of interpretation in the context of machine language, likening it to the Talmudic and Kabbalistic traditions of the Old Testament. He notes that, while the Macintosh and DOS universes have converged with the advent of Windows, the latter still offers a sense of freedom and flexibility, much like the Anglican tradition.

I hope you find this perspective as captivating as I do. It's a truly unique and thought-provoking view on the software schism.

Historically, this transformation began with a time when computers had more memory than they could utilize. Designers discovered ways to consume RAM more quickly than systems could provide it.

Dear John,

I wanted to follow up with you on our discussion regarding the SIC codes. As you know, Dave and I have been working on a list to determine which codes to include or exclude. I'm happy to report that we have reached an agreement on the following categories.

Primary Metals: We've agreed to include refining, but we believe grain and meat processing are too broad and may include many small retail loads. Dave will look into finding a solution to this issue.

Cement: We've agreed to include this category, with the understanding that it will encompass the big three and not the parts suppliers.

Aerospace: Unfortunately, we've had to exclude this category as EES already has global outsourcing deals with Boeing and Lockheed Martin.

"Dear Chip and Vipul,

I understand your concerns regarding the transparency of the TeS backend and its trust model. While I appreciate the hard work that has gone into developing the system, I believe it's essential to question the secrecy surrounding the details of TeS. As you mentioned, it's puzzling that a system designed to filter submissions cannot provide a clear explanation of its trust model and decision-making processes.

In your experience, Razor has been ineffective, with a relatively low hit rate. The uncertainty surrounding the trust model and the ""sooper secret"" methodologies used to determine submissions as spam or not only add to the frustration. I agree that a trust model that cannot withstand public scrutiny is not worth trusting.

I've recently upgraded the kernel on my home machine from 2.2.18pre21 to 2.4.19. Unfortunately, I've encountered a problem with my network card. Instead of having a single eth0 device on IRQ 10, I now have two devices, eth0 and eth1, both with the same IRQ values.

The output from the kernel logs indicates that the network card is being recognized and loaded, but it's not functioning properly. Packets can be sent out, but not received. I've tried not loading the 3c509 module at bootup and loading it manually with `modprobe 3c509 IRQ=10`, but the module still loads on IRQs 5 and 10 instead of the desired IRQ 10.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to you with great sadness and urgency. My father, Mr. Steve Mbeki Mulete, a prominent opposition party member and black farmer, was brutally murdered on his farm in Zimbabwe. The motive behind this heinous crime was his refusal to support the government's plan to redistribute white-owned farms to party members and the president's desire to gain favor for his re-election.

In his last moments, my father entrusted our local pastor and a close friend with documents containing his will and instructions to leave Zimbabwe immediately, should anything happen to him. The documents include a certificate of deposit, confirming a deposit of US$21.5M kept in custody at a security company, unknown to the company, as personal belongings.

As we are now in danger of being found by my father's enemies, we are seeking your assistance to help us transfer the funds out of Zimbabwe. The current ban on international press and the drop from office of the finance minister are just a few examples of the unthinkable actions the president is committing in our country.

We have concluded a plan to transfer the funds within two weeks and are willing to offer you 20% of the total sum upon confirmation of the funds in any account of your choice. We promise",1

We are in the process of developing a parser based on a theory of syntax that Derek Bickerton and I have been working on for the past four years. We are about to purchase a machine usable dictionary with approximately 70,000 entries for $2,500. Before doing so, we would appreciate any advice on whether this is the best option for us or if there are other dictionaries we should consider.

Our current dictionary has under 1,000 entries, and we need a larger one to work with larger corpora. We are also interested in learning about texts used in past parsing competitions and where the results are published. We believe that with a few weeks of work, we can modify the dictionary to experiment with texts used in these competitions.

Our parser is based on a series of algorithms that have taken four years to develop. However, the programming required to create it has only taken 300 hours using C++. The parser has approximately 3,000 lines of code and a disk size of 150k. It requires approximately 100k of RAM to run and 30k of disk space for a 300-word dictionary. On a 486 IBM-compatible, an average sentence takes under 4 seconds to process.

"Dear all,

As discussed at the meeting on Thursday, I am implementing the changes to the Humble Gas Pipeline (HGpl) and King Ranch Gas Plant (KGpl) based on our conversation. Please review the following changes, and if you disagree or have a different understanding, please reach out to me as soon as possible.

Firstly, I will purchase HPLC from Hplr Liquids at Meter 8793 (HPL/HGpl). I will remove the 3 Rivers Gas from the interconnect ticket and input the purchase deal accordingly.

Secondly, I will sell HPLC to Hplr Liquids at Meters 9643 (KGpl/HPL) and 12 (KGpl/HGpl). I will remove the 3 Rivers Gas volumes from the interconnect tickets at these meters and input the sales deals accordingly.

Thirdly, I will change the swing parameters for the King Ranch contracts to swing on Cage Ranch before swinging on 3 Rivers Gas. This should allow us to keep the sale of 3 Rivers Gas at one meter as much as possible.

It is my understanding that we will implement these changes effective February last. This may or may not affect the repathing of HPLC gas at Meter 9643",0
"""Hello,

I would like to draw your attention to a thought-provoking topic. It seems that societal norms have changed, and what was previously considered unusual or taboo is now becoming more common. For instance, imagine your neighbor's family engaging in intimate activities together on a quiet summer evening.

In this scenario, the daughter disrobes slowly and begins to fondle her father's genital area. Meanwhile, the son engages in anal intercourse with his mother, grunting with pleasure as he experiences orgasm. The mother then licks the semen from her son's penis and proceeds to caress her daughter's breasts, inviting her son to join her.

It's essential to acknowledge that these actions, although unusual, are becoming increasingly common. It's crucial to explore and understand these trends.

"Hi everyone,

I recently upgraded the kernel on a machine at home from version 2.2.18pre21 to the latest version 2.4.19. However, I encountered an issue with my network card. Instead of having one eth0 interface on IRQ 10, I now have two interfaces, eth0 and eth1, with IRQs 5 and 10 respectively.

When I try to receive packets, they cannot come in, but I can send packets out. I've tried not loading the 3c509 module on boot and then loading it manually with IRQ 10, but it still loads on IRQ 5 and 10. The same issue occurs with 2.4.19, but it works correctly in 2.2.x when using IRQ 10. Does anyone know if there's another IRQ I can use for the 3c509 module?

As I was not aware that the US had eradicated poverty, I was curious to know when this achievement occurred. I find it puzzling that the media seems to focus on the widening gap between the rich and the poor. 

It's essential to consider the continent's life expectancy and human carrying capacity before European settlement and compare it to the present day. This examination includes the original inhabitants, their descendants, and even those who were brought to the country against their will as slaves. 

Progress is often linked to increased affordability of goods and services. Poverty, in this context, is an absolute rather than relative concept. The disparity in wealth does not contribute to poverty. 

Similar to the idea that group rights exist, the notion of disparity in wealth is an oversimplification. Industrial wealth, on the other hand, is frequently transitory, and so is relative poverty, even when there are no confiscatory death taxes. The Forbes 400 list highlights that only a few individuals remain since 1982, a time with significantly higher marginal taxes on wealth, income, and inheritance. 

It's crucial to recognize that progress is slowed when neofeudalism reemerges through government regulation, confiscatory taxes, monopolies, corporate welfare, and",0

"I posted a query on linguist 8 about ambiguous words with a strongly dominant sense. The question was whether this dominant sense is most likely to be selected in neutral contexts. Although the intuitive answer seems to be ""yes,"" I haven't found any formal studies explicitly linking dominance bias or strength of activation to sense selection processes.

I also raised two general questions: Have the findings of Tabossi's research mostly discredited the purely modularist view of lexical processing? To what extent are connectionist explanations of lexical processing, such as Kawamoto's, gaining credibility among psycholinguists?

Dear Alexis,

I'd be happy to help you with the German linguistic terms you're looking for. The terms you're asking about relate to the phonetics of hissing and hushing fricatives.

For the hissing fricatives, also known as sibilants, the German term is ""Sibilanten"". These are sounds like the ""s"" and ""z"" in English, where air is pushed through the teeth and tongue, producing a hissing sound.

On the other hand, the hushing fricatives, also known as shibilants, are referred to as ""Huszanten"" in German. These sounds, like the ""sh"" in ""shoe"", are made by forcing air through the tongue, resulting in a soft, hushing sound.

As for the hissing-hushing fricatives, like the Polish ""s-acute"" and ""z-acute"", the German term is not as straightforward. However, one possible translation is ""Sibilant-Huszant-Bereich"" or ""Zisch-Husch-Bereich"", which roughly means ""the region of hissing-hushing fricatives"".

"If we consider the text recognition algorithm and its structure, it becomes clear why the first letter and, to a lesser extent, the last letter are crucial. Theoretically, without these initial and final letters, the text pattern recognition problem becomes exponentially more challenging, requiring deeper abstraction analysis. In contrast, the middle letters are less significant and computationally easier to resolve.

Furthermore, I believe it is essential to maintain a consistent number of middle letters in the correct spelling. It would be fascinating to explore if this same effect applies to written forms of other languages, including Japanese romongi. This could provide valuable insights into the patterns and structures of different languages.

I bought a 390 hp Mustang Cobra for around $35,000, and I couldn't be more thrilled. The car has been a real head-turner, and I've been enjoying every moment on the road.

Speaking of which, I just had a chance encounter with someone who owns a 2003 390 hp Mustang Cobra, and they were beaming with joy. I'm not surprised, considering the performance and value offered by this car.

On a separate note, I also purchased a Honda del Sol for my daily commute from San Bruno to San Jose. I'm curious if it would fit in the cargo area of a Mercedes-Benz G55, in case I need to transport it sometime.

Best regards,
Joe S. Barrera III

"Dear Sir/Madam,

We wanted to keep you updated on the latest developments regarding DA (Direct Access) legislation. The CPUC has postponed its vote to suspend DA until a meeting on September 13 at 2 PM. A new draft of the proposed decision has been issued, which makes the suspension effective on the day of the vote.

Additionally, a Direct Access bill may be voted on in the Senate today or tomorrow (SB XX-27), which would not suspend Direct Access. On the other hand, the ""Edison Bailout"" bill (SB XX-78) is scheduled to be voted on today in the Assembly, which would suspend Direct Access as of August 25.

Please note that everything is subject to change, and the legislature is set to end its session on September 14.

This book, edited by Ofelia Garcia and Joshua A. Fishman, explores the role of languages other than English in the life of New York City. As a general reader or language specialist, you will find this volume informative and engaging. The book is divided into five sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of urban multilingualism and the sociology of language.

The first section introduces the concept of the ""multilingual apple"" and provides an overview of New York City's multilingualism. The second section examines the languages of ethnolinguistic groups that have been somewhat silenced, such as Irish, German, and Yiddish.

The third section explores the languages of groups that made early contributions and continue to be heard in the city, including Italian, Greek, Spanish, and Hebrew. The fourth section looks at languages that are acquiring an important voice in the city today, including Chinese, Indian languages, English Creoles, and Haitian Creole.

The book concludes with a chapter on the languages with the newest sounds and newest faces, as well as a discussion on the special characteristics of New York City. The authors have made a significant contribution to the scholarly literature on urban multilingualism and the sociology of language.

We are excited to introduce Regalis, a generic version of Super Viagra, at an unbeatable price. Typically, pharmacies charge $22.95 for a single dose of Super Viagra, but we offer it for just $4.95. Regalis contains Tadalafil 20mg, the same active ingredient found in brand-name Cialis, which has been proven to help most men suffering from erectile dysfunction (ED).

Unlike brand-name Cialis, Regalis does not have a weekend-long effect; however, men who do not have ED issues report increased sexual pleasure, staying power, and larger, harder erections. Since Regalis is generic, it contains the exact same active ingredient as brand-name Cialis, making it safe for you to take, provided your doctor has cleared you for Cialis.

Regalis ships worldwide, including Canada, Japan, UK, and Australia, discreetly packaged to ensure confidentiality. We guarantee secure payment processing through major credit cards and checking accounts (for US customers only).

"A Brief Note on the German Word ""Loipe""

As I've been exploring the etymology of snow-related terms, I stumbled upon the German word ""Loipe"", which is a loanword from Norwegian. Interestingly, the Norwegian word ""LÃ¸ype"" is derived from Old Norse ""Hleypa"", meaning ""to make something run"" or ""to cause something to run"". According to the BokmÃ¥l Dictionary (1993), this etymology is confirmed.

"As the holiday season approaches, we would like to remind everyone to be aware of potential safety and security risks. With increased foot traffic and special events, there is a greater chance of fires and criminal activity.

We urge you to follow the following guidelines from the City of Houston Fire Department and the Houston Police Department:

Please refrain from propping open stairwell doors or doors to the freight elevators, as this defeats security measures. Artificial trees and greenery are recommended for decoration, while cut trees and greenery should be avoided due to fire hazards. Be mindful of distractions during office parties and remain vigilant for potential thieves.

Keep valuables with you or securely locked away, and avoid carrying too many packages when shopping. Be aware of your surroundings in public areas, and if something seems off, trust your instincts and avoid the area.

When waiting for a ride home after hours, remain inside the building near a card-reader door until your ride arrives. Finally, if office parties involve alcoholic beverages or public invitees, please contact security at 713-853-5360 for guidance.

"Dear Paul,

I agree with your statement that many genderless languages tend to be agglutinative, but not necessarily SOV. You've pointed out several examples, including Austro-Asiatic and Austronesian languages, as well as African and Native American languages, which are not SOV but still genderless.

I'd like to propose a refinement of the original statement. Instead of linking gender realization to SOV syntax, perhaps we could say that the realization of gender tends to be tied closely to the realization of morphological case, as you mentioned. This allows for more flexibility in the grammatical structure of genderless languages, as we've seen in various examples around the world.

Looking forward to continuing the discussion.

Dear colleagues,

I'm searching for information on languages with contrastive vowel length that don't represent this feature in their writing system. I'm particularly interested in cases of indigenous writing systems that ignore vowel length, as this seems to occur more frequently when a language adopts a writing system from a non-vowel-length language or when a non-native developer creates a writing system for a language.

The reason for my inquiry is Korean. It's reported to have contrastive vowel length, but it doesn't reflect this in its script. This, combined with the difficulty native speakers have in distinguishing which word contains a long vowel, leads me to question whether the distinction should be considered accent or stress rather than vowel length. However, this argument relies on the prevalence of writing systems ignoring vowel length.

What do you think? I'd appreciate any insights and will summarize responses if multiple responses are received.

"Some remarks about the epenthetic /g/ in Mongolian. Historically, it was not an epenthesis, but rather the result of a weakening and eventual elision of the consonant /g/ between vowels in proto-Mongolian. This /g/ was previously written in the Old Mongolian script and was phonetically a fricative sound (similar to the Greek ""gamma""). However, in ""soft"" words, /g/ was preserved, while in ""hard"" words it was lost. The epenthesis appeared as a result of this historical process, particularly in positions where two sequences of vowels followed each other. This shows that the direction of diachronic sound changes does not necessarily coincide with the direction of sound alternation viewed from a purely synchronic perspective.",0

I'm writing to share some humorous experiences and witty remarks that I've come across. I was reminded of them recently and thought I'd pass them along. As you read through these anecdotes, keep in mind that they're meant to be lighthearted and playful.

I've been fortunate enough to have had some amusing conversations with friends and family. For instance, I recall a girl who asked me to visit her when no one was home. I took her up on the offer, but unfortunately, no one was there to greet me.

There have also been some comical situations that have occurred in my daily life. One day, I arrived home early from work and saw a man jogging naked. When I asked him why, he simply replied that I had arrived home early.

I've had my share of mishaps, too. It's been a bit of a rough day, and I've experienced some misfortune. For instance, I put on a shirt, but the button fell off, and my briefcase broke as I picked it up. Now, I'm hesitant to visit the bathroom.

Dear President/CEO,

I am writing to you in confidence regarding a significant business opportunity that I believe has the potential to benefit both our organizations. As the newly appointed Telex/Money Transfer Director of Nigeria Apex Bank (Central Bank of Nigeria), I have been entrusted with the responsibility of managing a substantial sum of US$22 million.

This fund originated from an over-invoiced sum that was paid to a foreign company that executed a contract several years ago. The balance has been floating in a suspense account at the Central Bank of Nigeria for an extended period. In my capacity as Director of Telex/Money Transfer, I have been tasked with identifying a trustworthy partner to assist in transferring the funds outside Nigeria.

After careful consideration and thorough research, I have selected you as a potential partner due to your reputation as an honest and trustworthy individual. I would like to propose a partnership where we share the funds in a 30% to 70% ratio. I will retain 70% of the sum, which will be used to import valuable goods and purchase cars in Nigeria. You will receive 30% of the US$22 million, which will be transferred into your account abroad.

"Hi there,

I'd like to discuss a claim that President George W. Bush made about the French not having a word for ""entrepreneur."" According to a report in the British press, Bush made this comment during a conversation with British Prime Minister Tony Blair and French President Jacques Chirac about the French economy. However, Blair's director of communications and strategy, Alastair Campbell, has denied that Bush ever made this comment.

The story originated with Shirley Williams, a British politician, who claimed that Blair had told her about the conversation. However, Lloyd Grove of The Washington Post was unable to confirm the story with Williams, and Campbell denied that Bush ever made the comment.

This is not the first time Bush has been the subject of jokes and stories meant to highlight his intellectual abilities. Similar stories have circulated in the past, including a supposed study that ranked Presidential IQs, a fake Nostradamus quatrain predicting Bush's election, and a story about Bush waving at Stevie Wonder.

These kinds of stories will likely continue to circulate about Bush because they seem to confirm the widely held perception that he is not the brightest fellow that's ever been. But it's important to note that these stories are often false and should be treated with skepticism.

"This book develops the fundamental principles of linguistic change that form the foundation of historical linguistics, dialectology, and sociolinguistics. It focuses on the internal factors that govern the development of linguistic structures, including the mechanisms of change, constraints on change, and the embedding of change within the larger linguistic system.

Sociolinguistic theory has been a central area of research for over three decades, with the correlation of dependent linguistic variables with independent social variables providing the theoretical core of the discipline. This book reviews the essential findings of leading scholars in the field and places them in context with the work of other linguists who have followed in their footsteps.

This study examines the special relationship between Greek and Armenian within the Indo-European family, providing an in-depth analysis of the methods used to assess interrelationships within language families, the comparative reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European, the interpretation of Greek and Armenian texts, and the development of the Greek and Armenian languages.",0
"I agree with Stemberger that it's embarrassing to present the state of our discipline to an introductory class and admit that there is no single, objective coding system at the end of our field.

Instead of embracing this oversight, I propose that we take the opportunity to revise our approach. By adopting a unified coding system and aligning our spelling with phonetic pronunciation, we can demonstrate our commitment to clarity and professionalism. This would not only elevate our discipline but also ensure that our message is more effective and impactful when communicating with students, peers, and the wider academic community.

Let's take the initiative to correct these anomalies and set a new standard for our field. By doing so, we can proudly present our discipline in a more cohesive and refined manner, confident in the knowledge that our message is conveyed with precision and authority.",0

Dear Sir,

I am reaching out to you in search of assistance in investing a significant amount of money. My name is Captain John Okele, and I was the former Commander of the Security Guards of the late President Laurent Kabila of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Due to threats to my life and the lives of my family, I have been forced to seek refuge in remote Leicester City, Britain.

During the war in my country, I assisted President Kabila in storing US$35 million in a security company, disguised as personal effects. The company is unaware of the contents of the boxes. I am seeking your help in investing these funds before the current government, led by President Kabila's son, becomes aware of this money and attempts to seize it.

In return for your assistance, I am offering a 45% share of the funds, with 5% set aside for any expenses we may incur during the transaction. The remaining amount will be used to establish an account for my family's future investment.

I require a reliable and profitable long-term investment plan. Your suggestions and ideas are urgently needed. Please respond promptly and also provide your private email address and telephone/fax numbers, as confidentiality is crucial in this matter.

"I'm not sure why you think Geege's subject line is just dandy, unless you're a fan of anime. In my understanding, dead people can't send emails. However, I appreciate the creative twist. AOL might be a convenient option for mom-friendly bandwidth, but I still prefer other alternatives.

In anime, it's common to see dead people interact with the living in various ways, including sending emails. The trend seems to be that they're often the main characters. I suspect you might be referencing Serial Experiments Lain, where the initial ""I'm not dead yet"" is conveyed through an email.

Dear QuaffAPint,

I've re-read your email and identified the main issue: dependency problems with the packages you're trying to install. You're experiencing this on a RH 8 box when attempting to install the xine-0.9.13-fr5.i386.rpm package.

To resolve this, let's break down the dependencies required by each package:

* glut is needed by xine-libs-0.9.13-fr5
* aalib is needed by xine-libs-0.9.13-fr5
* lirc is needed by xine-libs-0.9.13-fr5
* libaa.so.1 is needed by xine-libs-0.9.13-fr5
* libglut.so.3 is needed by xine-libs-0.9.13-fr5

These dependencies are causing conflicts when you attempt to install the dev and lib rpm's. To overcome this, you can try installing the packages in a specific order or by using the '--without' option. However, this may not guarantee a successful installation.

I recommend trying to install the glut and aalib packages separately before attempting to install the xine-libs-0.9.",0

Dear list,

I'm experiencing a strange issue with one user, alfred, who is unable to authenticate to any SSH server using his public key, despite the fact that the same setup works fine for other users in our network. The problem persists even after generating new SSH keys and copying the.ssh directory from alfred's home directory to a new user's (alfio) home directory. Alfio is able to connect to the same servers without being prompted for a password.

The investigation reveals that the issue is specific to alfred's environment, as alfio is able to authenticate without issues. We use SSH2 with DSA keys, and the authentication mechanism is public-key-based. The `ssh-add -l` command for alfio shows the correct public key, whereas the same command for alfred does not.

I'm seeking guidance on what could be causing this issue, as it seems to be related to alfred's user profile rather than the SSH configuration.

To our valued Houston area employees participating in the Domestic Medical Plan,

We are writing to inform you that Memorial Hermann Health Systems (MHHS) has terminated its contract with United Healthcare (UHC) in the Houston/Beaumont area. As a result, some physicians will no longer be part of the network. We want to ensure you understand the situation and provide assistance during this transition.

The contract termination occurred due to MHHS's request for a significant fee increase, which UHC rejected. Despite the termination, UHC has negotiated with other hospitals in the area to maintain a network of healthcare providers. Many doctors have obtained admission privileges to other hospitals or contracted directly with UHC.

To minimize disruption to our employees and families, Enron has authorized UHC to process claims incurred between September 28 and December 31, 2000 as if the termination had not occurred. In-network benefits will apply, and there will be a $10 copayment for office visits, with 90% coverage for all other charges. Hospital admissions require pre-certification with UHC.

"We recently came across an interesting article on the Newssifree website that explores the potential benefits of interspecies breeding in conservation efforts. The article suggests that using one species to develop the eggs of another could be a game-changer for endangered species and potentially even for women facing fertility challenges.

While the concept may seem unconventional, the idea is rooted in the natural world. Certain species of frogs, for example, have been observed laying eggs that can be fertilized by the sperm of other frog species. This phenomenon has sparked a new area of research, which could hold the key to reviving endangered species.

One of the most promising aspects of this approach is its potential to help species recover more quickly. By introducing healthy, fertilized eggs into a population, conservationists could accelerate the process of reestablishing a species. Additionally, the research could also lead to breakthroughs in human fertility treatments.

The article highlights the potential for this technology to be used in a variety of situations, from reviving endangered species to helping women overcome infertility issues. As research continues to advance, we may see this innovative approach become a crucial tool in the conservation and medical communities.",0

I'm grateful for the opportunity to discuss the book ""The Business of Heaven"" with you. As Bob Darden mentioned, I'd be happy to provide more information about the book's content and authors.

Dear esteemed partner,

I am reaching out to you with a lucrative opportunity to partner in a significant financial transaction. As my dear friend, I believe you would be interested in accommodating a profiling amount of USD $423 million. In recognition of your collaboration, I am willing to offer you a 40% share of the total sum.

Please note that I, Lioudmila Kimaeva, serve as the personal secretary to Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the owner of Yukos Oil and Menatep Sbp Bank. The source of these funds is a result of a recent oil deal between my boss and an American oil merchant. The funds have been deposited with Treasury Services Europe, with a pending crediting process.

However, due to unforeseen circumstances, my boss has been arrested in connection with alleged political offenses. As a result, I must act swiftly to relocate to the American continent and disassociate myself from Mikhail Khodorkovsky's conglomerates.

Your role would be to serve as the beneficiary of the USD $423 million, and I will arrange for the necessary documentation to facilitate the transfer of funds through Treasury Services Europe. I kindly request your prompt response and willingness to comply with this proposal within the next two weeks, as Mikhail Khodorkovsky is",1

Dear Mr. P. O. Williams,

I am writing to express my sincerest apologies for sending unsolicited mail to you. I found your profile on a human resource database and believed you to be a respected individual. I would like to bring to your attention a matter of great importance, which has garnered significant media attention worldwide. My husband, Isaac Nuhan Vaye, was a prominent figure in Liberian politics, serving as the Deputy Minister of Public Works. He was falsely accused of plotting to overthrow the then President of Liberia, Charles Taylor, and was tragically killed without a trial.

Before his untimely death, my husband managed to transfer $21.5 million through diplomatic means and deposited it with a security company abroad. To facilitate the transfer of these funds to your account, we require your assistance. My lawyer, Mr. Barrister, can instruct the company to transfer the funds, and we are willing to offer you a 20% commission for your services.

"This workshop aims to re-examine the assumptions implicit in much language acquisition research, focusing on the complexity of circumstances in which language acquirers operate. The meeting will address questions such as how to integrate discourse-analytic and anthropological descriptions of communicative interaction, how to extend the notion of ""shared context"" to capture the construction of meaning in unfolding discourse, and how to make acquisition theories more sensitive to complex linguistic and sociocultural environments.

We invite people and paradigms from L1 and L2 acquisition research to explore the interrelations between multiple contexts of language acquisition, aiming to theoretically model these relationships with ecosystemic validity. Although we can only accommodate 30 ""real"" participants, we are making provision for remote partial participation via email (with possible audio links).

In this book, Kiyoshi Ishikawa presents a network theory of reference that addresses specific limitations of truth-conditional approaches. He draws on features of discourse representation theory, file change semantics, and situation semantics to develop a dynamic theory of reference that describes meaning in terms of the psychological relationship between language and our cognition of external reality.

Ishikawa argues that a linguistic expression's meaning is its potential to change the information state of a cognitive agent. In this context, reference is not understood as a link to a real individual external to an agent, but as the agent's act to link a character in a linguistic frame of individuation to characters in other (linguistic or nonlinguistic) frames.

The book provides an in-depth analysis of the distinction between referential and attributive uses of definite descriptions through the construction of conversation scenarios. Ishikawa also extends his theory to an analysis of belief and attitude reports, and applies it to cleft and pseudocleft constructions.

Presented in a clear and accessible style, this theory will be of interest to scholars in cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and philosophy, as well as linguistics. The book is now available for purchase, and prepaid orders can be placed by U.S. check or money",0

"I apologize for the confusion, and I appreciate your feedback. Upon re-reading my previous email, I realize that I failed to mention the intended platform, Windows, which led to a mismatched response from the group.

I was seeking guidance on autorun CDs, specifically for Windows. I came across a useful resource at http://www.avdf.com/mar97/art_autorun.html, which provided valuable insights into Windows-related autorun issues. In hindsight, I should have clarified the platform from the beginning, which would have led to more relevant and accurate responses from the group.

I understand that this may have wasted the time of those who provided Linux-related information, and I apologize for the inconvenience. I will make sure to be more clear in the future when requesting assistance on a specific platform.

Dear friend,

I am writing to you to express my gratitude for your attention to this matter. As the widow of Mr. Ronald Tshabalala, I am seeking your assistance in facilitating the release of funds due to my late husband's company, Tshabalala Construction Ltd. The funds, amounting to $25 million, are a result of an over-invoiced contract my husband's company executed with the government of South Africa.

"Subject: Insider Selling at Enron - Concerns Raised

Dear Sir/Madam,

We would like to bring to your attention an observation that has caught our attention. Recent insider selling activity at Enron has raised concerns about the company's financial health. According to our research, multiple senior executives have been actively selling their Enron shares, with some selling over 75% of their holdings in the past quarter alone. This significant increase in insider selling is unusual and warrants scrutiny.

Historically, insider selling has been seen as a sign of investor uncertainty or potential financial distress. The timing of this selling activity is particularly concerning, given the company's recent financial struggles and the lack of transparency regarding its financial situation. We believe it is essential for investors to be aware of this information and to consider the potential implications for Enron's stock performance.

"Setup a VPN between multiple sites is a daunting task, as it requires careful consideration of various options. From my research, I have narrowed down the choices to IPsec using FreeSWAN or CIPE. While FreeSWAN is a widely-accepted implementation of IPsec, it might require more setup time and hassle compared to CIPE. However, CIPE is Linux-specific, which presents an issue since some sites run OS-X.

I'm seeking advice from those who have implemented both FreeSWAN and CIPE to understand the differences in setup time and complexity between the two. If CIPE is easier to set up, I may consider using a Linux box for each remote site. In this case, the cost of hardware would be justified by the simplicity of software setup.

"Hi all,

When compiling, you may need to include the directory path '-L/usr/lib/X11' (or '-L/usr/X11R6/lib') to ensure everything works as expected. Although ld/gcc is smart enough to handle arguments in any order, ld does not follow this design principle and expects arguments to be in a specific order.

"I think laptops are largely impractical because of the battery life and the keyboard layout issues. For instance, the G4 keyboard has a poor feel and key placement, which is why I'm holding onto my IBM Model M Space Saver. However, the keyboard does have one advantage: it's great for inserting USB fobs. CRT and LCD panels are even more suitable for this task, but they require a connection that's close to the keyboard and USB port.

That's why I think laptops are essentially useless. The battery life is a major concern, and the keyboard layout issues are a significant drawback. The experience is improved with the use of a PS2 to USB converter, but even so, I still prefer my IBM keyboard.",0

"I'd like to discuss the proposed espresso tax, which targets high-income consumers who spend $3 to $4 on a single serving. The idea is to create a modern-day Robin Hood tax, where the affluent support the needy. While the proposal may affect employment, the 1% or less sales tax is relatively insignificant.

However, there's a concern about the cost of tracking revenue and collecting the tax, which might outweigh the benefits of the tax itself.

"I'm surprised you're suggesting that no one has experienced memory leaks in their programming career. As a matter of fact, even expert C/C++ programmers can encounter these issues. However, most developers use tools to track memory management, such as adding a flag or running their code through specialized software. This helps identify memory leaks, allowing for swift resolution.

It's true that basic understanding of hardware can simplify memory management, but this may not be the case for every programmer. Therefore, it's essential to acknowledge the importance of memory management in programming, even for those who have a grasp of the underlying hardware.

Under the California Update 3, it is crucial that the utility creditors, particularly QFS, address the issue of undercollection, which remains a sticking point. If this issue is not resolved in today's CAPUC hearings, involuntary bankruptcy is likely. The CAPUC has set a 40% rate increase, pending the details of the DWR power purchase. Davis defends his stance of no rate increase, distancing himself from CAPUC and QF/Generator undercollection.

The undercollection by the utilities will not be addressed in today's CAPUC hearings and could invite involuntary bankruptcy by QFS and generators. The recent rate hikes proposed by CAPUC dictate that any revenue generated from rate increases cannot be used to pay off past debt, leaving QFS with little hope of recovery. CAPUC's draft order has dismayed QFS, and if passed, an involuntary bankruptcy filing is still likely.

Today, CAPUC holds rate increase hearings, as reported yesterday, with the release of the CAPUC's draft rate increase order by Loretta Lynch. A 3-cent/kWh surcharge on power bills, or roughly a 40% rate increase, is expected. A portion of this ""surcharge"" will go to the DWR to cover its costs, and",0

"Regarding the point about French consumer law, it seems that the sale of software without a guarantee breaches the law. The reason for this is that software is considered a service that is licensed rather than a product that is sold. This is how Microsoft and other software companies are able to provide no guarantee, claiming that the software is delivered ""with all faults.""

However, this raises questions about the validity of Microsoft, Adobe, and other software licenses that claim no liability and no guarantees. It would seem that these companies may be in breach of French consumer law if they do not provide some form of guarantee.

"This volume in the Studies in Language Companion Series presents a comprehensive analysis of nominal classification systems, specifically in Aboriginal Australian languages. The editors, Marc Harvey and Nicholas Reid, have gathered contributions from renowned experts in the field to explore the semantic bases and discourse role of classification systems.

The book examines the complexity of classification systems, where a significant percentage of nominals appear to be arbitrarily classified. The contributors build upon previous research, proposing that arbitrariness has a significant role from a socio-cultural perspective. They also argue that reference instantiation and tracking cannot be properly separated.

The volume provides detailed information on classification in several Northern Australian languages, which are often poorly understood. The chapters explore topics such as head classes and agreement classes, class and classifier relationships, and the typological comparison of noun classification systems.

The contributors include some of the most prominent scholars in the field, and their work offers valuable insights into the complexities of nominal classification systems. This volume is essential reading for anyone interested in the study of language, semantics, and linguistics.",0

Dear Dave,

In regards to the topic of Quality Control Charts, Begeman's Manufacturing Processes discuss the importance of plotting data on a control chart. The control chart serves as a record of the variation of an inspected dimension over a period of time. When the data plotted falls within the control limits, it indicates that the process is operating correctly, and the parts are being made correctly 99.73% of the time.

However, if the data points fall outside of the control limits, it may indicate that there are assignable causes for variation present. In such cases, the process should be checked and corrected immediately.

Taking a look at the S&P 500 and using historical data, we can analyze the performance of the stock. Using the Ibbotson 2000 figures of 13% expected stock return and 20% standard deviation, we find that the actual return on the S&P since 31 Dec 1999 is close to -30%. When we plot this data, it falls within the control limits. This means that no adjustments or changes in the process are necessary.

If we had plotted the data during the ""long"" bull market, we may have found that the process was not in control. However, in this case, the data falls",0

It's concerning that transmission prices could reach $50/tcf, and I'm not convinced that telling a pipeline company to operate at a higher pressure is the best solution, especially given the risk of accidents like the recent pipeline explosion in our area. Perhaps the judge has a valid point, and we'll see as the appeal proceeds.

I've come across an article that reports a federal judge's ruling that the nation's largest natural gas pipeline company, El Paso, illegally withheld gas from the market during California's energy crisis in 2000-01. The judge concluded that El Paso left 21% of its capacity offline, driving up gas prices and contributing to rolling blackouts.

This raises questions about the role of regulation in influencing prices. While overregulation can have hidden costs and single out certain individuals, I believe that excessive spending can spread its impact more evenly.

It's also important to note that proponents of increased government spending and regulation often reject the notion that there is a balance between the two. In my experience, people who identify as ""Green"" are often motivated by a desire to reduce environmental impact, not necessarily a desire to impose both excessive spending and regulation.

"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share a humorous story that happened recently. A pastor walked into a local pub, and at first, everyone was having a great time, but occasionally the lights would flicker off. When the lights went out, the crowd would erupt into cheers, but as soon as they saw the town pastor, the room fell silent.

The pastor approached the bartender and asked to use the restroom. The bartender hesitated, explaining that a statue of a naked woman with a fig leaf covering her private area was inside. The pastor, undeterred, said he would simply look the other way.

The bartender showed him to the restroom, and after a few minutes, the pastor returned, and the music and dancing resumed. However, the crowd stopped long enough to give the pastor a loud round of applause. Confused, the pastor asked the bartender why he was receiving such an accolade.

The bartender revealed that the crowd now knew the pastor was ""one of us,"" implying that the pastor had joined in on the secret, and the applause was a gesture of appreciation. The bartender then offered the pastor a drink, joking that the reason the lights went out earlier was because the fig leaf was lifted, and the entire place had to pause.

"I am seeking assistance in resolving an issue with Conagra. According to my understanding, on Wednesday, May 2, 2001, Conagra called our scheduling group regarding a cut to a day-ahead schedule for the HE 7. Cara took the call and informed Conagra that the cut had to be done in real-time because it was the day of flow. She then transferred the call to Real-Time. I was wondering if any of you received a call from Conagra regarding a cut to our schedule going to Conagra, likely at the beginning of your shift. Conagra claims they spoke to a male representative in Real-Time, but I could not find any cut information in the discussion database or in writing, nor were there any cuts recorded in ENPOWER. Unfortunately, the Lotus Notes schedule information for this day is missing. Conagra is charging us $6,625.00 for having to resupply themselves. I have asked them to pull their tapes and identify who they spoke to in Real-Time. I thought I would seek the story from our side before proceeding. Any assistance you can provide would be greatly appreciated.",0

To address this issue, I've created dummy packages that explicitly provide the necessary capabilities. However, I'm unsure how to proceed with creating such packages.

"If the creator did not explicitly grant permission to use their work without compensation, it's considered theft. This principle is not limited to any particular holy book, as it's a fundamental moral imperative.

I recently came across a website that attempted to clarify the original meaning of the Ten Commandments. It's fascinating to see how the interpretations of these commandments have evolved over time. One specific example is the concept of stealing, which, according to this website, was originally intended to prohibit the act of selling a free person into slavery. It's interesting to note that this interpretation resonated particularly strongly with people from the American South, who had a complex relationship with the term ""man stealer.""

"I'd like to share my thoughts on the best UI (User Interface) among Mac OS 9, Mac OS X, and Windows. While opinions are divided, it's interesting to note that Tim O'Reilly, a well-known figure in the tech industry, initially disliked Mac OS 9, but has since come to appreciate Mac OS X. On the other hand, some traditional Mac users are skeptical of the new operating system, deeming it too different from the classic Mac OS 9 design.

Despite these differing opinions, it's clear that each UI has its own strengths and weaknesses. Mac OS 9, for instance, was a more familiar and straightforward environment for traditional Mac users, but it may have lacked some of the modern features and polish of newer operating systems. In contrast, Mac OS X introduced a more contemporary and sleek design, but some users may have initially found it difficult to adapt to the new layout and functionality.

As for Windows, it has its own set of features and design choices, which have likely appealed to some users while alienating others. In conclusion, while the best UI remains a matter of personal preference, it's fascinating to explore the different opinions and experiences people have had with these operating systems.",0
"I'd like to reiterate my point that we need more than just symbolic gestures to bring about real change. Instead, we need people willing to take concrete action and face the consequences. Bruce Perens, an open source campaigner, plans to do just that by openly defying the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) during a presentation at the O'Reilly developer conference in San Diego.

Perens' planned demonstration is a bold move, given the risks involved. He'll be showing how to hack a DVD player to play movies from any region, which could result in imprisonment or a $500,000 fine. However, his actions are a powerful statement against the region-based DVD restrictions imposed by the motion picture industry.

Perens' message is clear: people should have the freedom to use their devices as they see fit, without restrictions. His actions are a call to action, encouraging others to join him in breaking the law and demanding change. It's a provocative move, but one that could spark meaningful change in the open source community.",0

In the book ""History of the Magic of a Common Language"" by Jakobson, Mathesius, Trubetzkoy, and the Prague Linguistic Circle, Jindrich Toman explores the historical factors and tenets of the Prague Linguistic Circle, focusing on the social and cultural environment that shaped the development of linguistics.

Another book, ""Ling Semiotics"" by Yishai Tobin, presents a contrastive study of sign systems in English and Hebrew, examining invariance, markedness, and distinctive feature analysis. The study demonstrates how linguistic forms and constructions, despite being classified similarly, function differently across languages. Tobin argues that semantic domains and features are marked by distinct sets of features, leading to differences in language-specific usage.

In ""Current Issues in Linguistic Theory"", Rosina Lippi-Green contributes to language ideology and language change in early modern German. Her sociolinguistic study of the consonantal system of Nuremberg, based on a computerized corpus, employs multivariate statistical procedures to analyze the interaction of linguistic, social, and stylistic factors on written language variation. The study highlights the quantification of an individual's relationship to language standardization and its impact on written language variation.",0

"I'd like to contribute my native speaker intuition to this discussion about the sentence ""John asked Mary to leave"". As a native speaker of English (New Zealand English), I agree with the points raised by Wayne Lawrence and Marilyn Silva. When considering the sentence, I can only interpret the person being asked as the one required to leave the room. There's an undeniable pragmatic element in both examples, ""The teacher asked the child to leave the room"" and ""The child asked the teacher to leave the room"". In both cases, the teacher is assumed to be in authority, and the child is not. Therefore, [1] immediately evokes a normal situation, while [2] requires a re-interpretation, as ""kids don't do that"" except in special circumstances.

I have to agree with Wayne that the immediate interpretation is that the person being asked is expected to leave. This interpretation is a function of syntax. Only when you consider the syntactically generated interpretation do pragmatic constraints force you to re-evaluate. For me, it's a distinctly two-stage process, with the second stage triggered only if there are issues with the first. In the case of ""John asked Mary to leave"", I believe syntax has it.",0

"If it wasn't DeSoto, then who was it that landed in Southern Florida to be greeted by great cities of millions of mound-dwellers who had completely vanished by the time Cortez arrived to kill as many as he could?

To correct some inaccuracies, it was actually Juan Ponce de LeÃ³n who discovered Florida, not Cortez. Moreover, there were never millions of natives in Florida, at least not until recent times.

Cortez never set foot in Florida, as he focused on Mexico and the Aztec Empire. Ponce de LeÃ³n did encounter Indian peoples in Florida, but they remained there until a significant portion of them relocated to Cuba with the Spanish due to an influx of Seminole Indians from the north, brought by the English in the 17th century. The remaining natives likely merged with the new population, died out, or otherwise disappeared, and their culture became extinct.",0

"I was considering using the command 'lilo -b /dev/hdb -r /mnt', but I think that '-b' is equivalent to the 'boot' keyword in lilo.conf. Alternatively, will this command simply work automatically? In other words, 'boot = /dev/hda' in lilo.conf instructs lilo what sector numbers to modify and it figures out where the disk is from the '-r' option.

Unfortunately, that approach won't work as you intend. You'll end up with a boot loader on the backup disk that contains the ""physical"" location of the /boot/map file on the main disk, which might not be the same as the backup disk.

I'm struggling to find a suitable solution using LILO. I have a similar setup on my home machine (rsync to a backup disk every night), but I'll have to reinstall RH if I need to perform a disk swap. I'll be pulling out the RH install CDs to resolve the LILO issue.

In the wake of two coordinated attacks in Egypt, a woman identified as Negat Yassin emerged as a key figure. Just over an hour after the initial attack on a tour bus carrying Israeli tourists, Yassin shot and wounded her companion, before taking her own life. The second attack occurred when Yassin, who was said to be a sister of the initial target, attempted to assassinate Egyptian police officials. Her actions were motivated by a desire for revenge following the death of her brother, Khamis.

In the aftermath of the attacks, Egyptian police officials reported the capture of two suspects, Ashraf Saeed Youssef and Gamal Ahmed Abdel Aal, in connection with the initial bus attack. A third suspect, Ehab Youssef Yassin, the brother of Negat Yassin, attempted to evade capture by jumping from a highway overpass, setting off a nail-filled bomb in the process.

The attacks were claimed by two militant groups, the Mujahedeen of Egypt and the Abdullah Azzam Brigades, although the authenticity of these claims could not be verified. Women are not known to have carried out past attacks in Egypt, making Negat Yassin's actions a notable exception. According to Fouad Allam, a",1

"Dear Vince and Grant,

I've been reviewing recent references on Extreme Value Theory (EVT) and its applications. I'll get back to you shortly with some points on the usefulness of EVT and how traders (electricity and weather) can benefit from it.

Regarding your inquiry, to my knowledge, the research group is primarily examining EVT in the context of Value at Risk calculations. We haven't explored EVT for power applications yet, as we've been focusing on shorter-term fundamental forecasting of price excursions. Specifically, we use load forecasts and expected plant dispatch to predict which lines will become constrained and how the system will react to alleviate these constraints.

I'd be interested in your thoughts on how EVT can benefit traders. Regarding the weather aspect, I expect the weather desk to use EVT at some level. You may want to discuss this further with Joe Hrgovic, the research chap attached to the weather desk, for a more accurate assessment.

Best regards,

"As I understand it, there is increasing genetic evidence suggesting that European immune systems are more resilient and resistant to a wider range of infectious diseases compared to those found in other parts of the world. One theory behind this is that Europe was the first major region to become densely populated and urbanized, which occurred around a thousand years ago. Another theory is that Europe remained a rural area, even compared to large urban centers like Constantinople and Baghdad, until the Renaissance.

I am not familiar with the specific genetic studies you mentioned, but I am aware of one relevant finding: it appears that men of Ashkenazi descent are susceptible to sickle-cell anemia, which is likely due to a genetic factor that provides protection against tuberculosis. This would have been beneficial for Jewish populations living in urban areas of central Europe, where tuberculosis was a significant threat. R</START>",0

I'm writing to report a few issues I've encountered while using exmh, and I'm not sure if they're related to my setup or the program itself. I'd appreciate your insight into these problems.

The first issue I've noticed is that exmh takes a long time to start when I use the wish shell from tk8.4.0, whereas it starts quickly when I use the wish shell from tk8.a.4.

When I open exmh and navigate to a folder with unseen messages, and then click ""Next"", exmh changes to the next folder with unseen messages, rather than the first unseen message in the current folder. This behavior seems inconsistent with my expectations.

When I reach the end of the messages in a folder and move on to the next unseen message, exmh always returns to the inbox (which, of course, has no unseen messages). Instead, I would expect it to go to the next folder with unseen messages. Interestingly, when I click ""Next"" from the inbox, exmh behaves as I would expect.

I wanted to bring these issues to your attention and find out if I'm expecting something different than I should be. Any insights you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

"Hi,

I've been noticing that my Debian setup allows for a feature that's not available on my Red Hat boxes. I'd like to bring this to your attention. I've discovered a fascinating project called Falconseye, which seems to be a graphical interface to the game Nethack. You can access the website at http://falconseye.sourceforge.net/.

I've noticed that the RPM files provided on the website are compatible with RH7.3, based on NH3.x, which was previously included in RH7.1's powertools. This feature is, of course, apt-compatible. Additionally, the RPM also includes Text-Iconv, which is a nice bonus.

One minor issue I've encountered is that the GPG key was not immediately available, even though vendors.list lists the key IDs. However, I was able to resolve this by accessing the key at /apt/vs.key.asc.

Thanks for bringing this to my attention, and I hope you can help clarify this discrepancy between Debian and Red Hat.

If you believe the GNU General Public License (GPL) grants you the right to obtain free software, you are mistaken. The GPL does not provide for free software. 

My impression was that all you needed to do was pay for the media and not the code itself, but that is not the case. According to the GPL, if you have lawfully received a copy of the covered binary version, you have the right to also receive the matching source code.

The GPL makes no requirements regarding the cost of binaries. In fact, you can obtain the sources for a program like GNU's /bin/true, compile it yourself, and sell the resulting binary for any amount you choose. However, the GPL does stipulate that you must provide the sources for that binary if someone requests them. 

This means that while you can sell binaries, you must also provide the sources to anyone who asks. This can make it difficult to create a business model based solely on reselling GPL software, as the market will always be able to access the sources for free.

There are ways to provide value to customers when selling GPL software, such as offering a convenient installer, vendor-supplied updates, or a CD with the software and its sources. There will always be segments of the",0

"I understand that the current antimissile defense is insufficient to protect against a 2 km diameter rock or rubble target, even if it's in the form of dust and gas. The defense system is designed for operations in low Earth orbit (LEO) and is effective against smaller targets through kinetic kill or nearby nuclear detonation.

However, a 100 MT warhead would not fragment the target significantly, as it would be too slow to vaporize it in the few seconds left before impact. Even if the target was vaporized, there would still be an impact on the Earth's energy balance, affecting the atmosphere rather than the lithosphere or hydrosphere.

In this case, the only effective way to protect against such a large target is to determine its orbits with high precision and deflect it over a long period of time, taking decades to do so.",0

"Taxes should be levied based on an individual's ability to pay. This principle is essential to our American system. To emphasize, the absence of proof does not prove the absence of taxes.

We are ready to release the different versions of vatrfacs code, developed by Jin over the last half year. The recent developments include:

* Weighting log-returns with an exponential decay factor when calculating correlations
* Calculating factors and correlations for UK curves
* Joint estimation of factor loadings for selected groups of commodities
* An alternative method for collecting historical data for correlation calculations (based on fixed contracts instead of collecting prompt, prompt + 1, etc. prices)

Before releasing these developments, we need to have each version under ClearCase. Then, we will:
* Run vatrfacs code in the stage environment (which has been refreshed recently)
* Run var code in the stage and validate the results

It is time to start releasing these four versions, with projects 3 and 4 requiring some experimental runs in the stage. A few traders in the gas, power, and liquids markets are expecting the results.

Additionally, the following developments have been suggested by research, approved by risk control, and submitted as spreadsheet prototypes, waiting in line:
* Volatility blending for intramonth power positions
* Forward volatility smoothing and extracting forward forward volatilities

If I had to buy a piece of property, I'd want to ensure I had clear ownership. Unfortunately, there are many reasons why people can't own land. In some cases, it's because it's government land, and you need an army of lawyers to convert it. In other cases, original owners didn't have the right to subdivide, but they did it anyway. Interestingly, in Japan, it was a death sentence to sell land for centuries, but they sold it and kept records.

In the US, we eventually integrated squatters and adverse possession into our official law. Mr. Long, I think you'd particularly enjoy the De Soto work.

In the Philippines, it takes 20 years to get legal title. In Egypt, about 80% of the population in Cairo lives in places where they are officially illegal. People squat on land without owning it due to the desire for jobs. For people to buy their own land, capitalism must be healthy but not triumphant.

- The major landowners in India before independence were relatively well-off. In the US, we're not too friendly to our capitalists, and adverse possession only takes 5 years. We owe a lot to our frontiers, and didn't Egypt pretty much invent geometry",0

"Dear Vince,

I am responding to your request for a monthly or quarterly price history in nominal terms for a US onshore Louisiana natural gas price (or a Texas wellhead price) and a UK landed beach price for the past 15 years. I understand that this information is required for Jim O'Hara's project related to the Colombia pipeline in South America.

"I would like to discuss the notion of global warming. When considering geological timescales, I believe it's essential to acknowledge that the human historical record is often misleading. The recent changes in global temperature, both in absolute terms and over time, are arguably dwarfed by natural fluctuations that have occurred over the past 50,000 years. The noise floor of these fluctuations is so high that even the most recent changes may be insignificant.

I'm skeptical of theories attributing global warming to human activities because they don't adequately explain why temperatures were more extreme in the past. Moreover, I'm not convinced that the receding glaciers are a significant issue, as they have always been transient and have unearthed substantial evidence of human civilizations in the past.

Rather than relying on hypothetical assertions, I think it's more logical to consider the geological evidence and Occam's Razor. In my opinion, there's no compelling reason to assume that current fluctuations are anthropogenic.

Please let me know your thoughts on this matter.",0

"This book explores French complementation, focusing on the distribution of infinitival and finite complements (indicative and subjunctive) in various contexts, such as causation/perception, modal, sentential complement, and impersonal constructions. In line with the principles of cognitive linguistics, the book argues that surface forms reflect specific cognitive organizations, and formal differences convey conceptual differences. The authors demonstrate that each complement form carries meaning, which can be expressed in terms of the cognitive organization it represents, and that the distribution of these forms is determined by the semantic compatibility between main verbs. The book proposes a solution that departs from existing analyses in three major ways, accounting for form and distribution, positing no construction-specific devices, and providing a global understanding of complementation by treating various constructions in similar ways.",0
"Dear all,

I'm writing to clarify a point regarding the attention given to methodological issues in linguistics, particularly in regards to establishing very distant linguistic relationships like Nostratic. As you may know, Language magazine has not published a review of Illich-Svitych's books, despite a scholar agreeing to review them. However, research in the same tradition has been reviewed in our journal. For instance, Bernard Comrie's review of Starostin's book on Altaic and Japanese was published in Language 69:828-832 (1993). The methodological issues involved in the Altaic and Japanese case are similar to those in the Nostratic case.

I'm puzzled by the open-letter signers' apparent belief that the Russian approach to these issues has received no attention in Language. If there's any further discussion or clarification needed, please feel free to reach out.

"Hi,

Before using the Win32 files, you need to obtain them and then configure MPlayer to use them by setting the ""--enable_win32"" option.

I'm still seeking an answer to this question. The MPlayer documentation suggests using the Win32 files for x86 architectures, but I'm not sure if there are licensing issues or other reasons why we shouldn't use them. I've noticed performance and feature differences between using and not using the Win32 codecs, including issues with full-screen playback and visual artifacts on NVIDIA cards.

Unfortunately, my family has been faced with a series of unfortunate events.

Hi All,

The modem handshake functions at higher speeds (up to 57,600 bps), but that's not suitable for transmitting data to the remote server at the pace of 1,200 bps. The remote server insists on communicating at a slow speed. It seems that the flow control is set to Xon/Xoff instead of hardware-based.

The modem configuration is set to 1,200 bps, 7 data bits, and even parity. This is unusual, as 8-n-1 is more common. I reset the modem by sending an ATZ3 command, followed by the initialization string:

AT&F1E1V1Q0X4Y0S32=232&A1&B0&C1&D2&H0&I0&K1&M4&N0&P0&R1&S0&U0&Y1

What can wordplay - - as understood in the broadest sense - - teach us about language, its functions, characteristics, structure, and workings? Using Lewis Carroll's Alice as a starting point, Yaguello takes the reader on a vivid and unconventional voyage into the world(s) of language, charting the major themes of linguistics along the way. This is an entertaining and original introduction to the nature of language that will appeal to students and teachers alike.

In this book, we explore the major issues of linguistics, including the nature of language, its structure, and its use. We delve into the world of language, examining the ways in which language is used to communicate, and the ways in which it is shaped by the cultures and societies in which it is used. We also explore the ways in which language is influenced by social, cultural, and historical factors, and the ways in which it is used as a tool for power and control.

The book is organized around the themes of language, culture, and society, and includes discussions of key concepts such as language contact, multilingualism, and linguistic imperialism. It is a comprehensive and authoritative introduction to the field of linguistics, and is designed to be accessible to students and teachers at all",0
"Hi team,

I'd like to discuss my concerns regarding the Habeas Infringers List (HIL) and its potential to reduce spam. While I understand how the business model works, I'm unsure if it will actually make a significant impact. My concern is that there's a lack of empirical evidence demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing spam.

Historically, spammers have operated without legal consequences, and it's unclear how the HIL will change this. I'm not questioning the incentive to pursue spammers, but rather the indirect effect this may have on the amount of spam received.

I also worry that the HIL's design may lead to spam avoiding being tagged as spam. Daniel, you have the capability to adjust the Habeas scores yourself. If the HIL fails to meet its promises, I'm confident that Justin and Craig will remove us from the next release.

I propose starting with a less aggressive score and gathering evidence that the system works before increasing its magnitude. This approach would allow us to test and refine the HIL's effectiveness before introducing more aggressive measures.

Please let me know your thoughts on this matter.

Call for Papers: Workshop on Constraints and Preferences at PLM '99

The Poznan Linguistic Meeting (PLM) is pleased to announce a call for papers for a workshop on constraints and preferences, to be held during PLM '99, the 32nd Poznan Linguistic Meeting. The workshop will explore recent developments in linguistic theory, with a focus on the epistemological compatibility of constraints and preferences.

The workshop aims to examine various aspects of constraints and preferences, including:

* The nature of both constraints and preferences, and their relationship
* The scalar nature of preferences versus the absolute nature of constraints
* Hierarchy versus rule order
* Constraints versus rules/processes
* The predictive and explanatory power of constraints and preferences
* Constraints/preferences and online processing
* The learnability problem
* Pro/contra parallelisms between diachronic change and synchronic rules/processes
* Phonological and phonetic constraints, with illustrations and empirical evidence

Confirmed speakers include:

* Wolfgang U. Dressler (Vienna)
* Rajendra Singh (Montreal)
* Nikolaus Ritt (Vienna)
* Martin Prinzhorn (Vienna)

Abstracts should be submitted in one-page format to dkasia@ifa.amu.edu.pl",0

However, kernel-source and kernel-headers are specifically listed in the ""HoldPkgs"" section, which means they will not be installed, even if they would normally be duplicates.

I'd like to share my experience about using open wireless access points. After discovering a nearby network, I interviewed experts from law enforcement, academia, and WiFi activism about the legality and ethics of accessing these points. As I browsed the web, I checked my email and news media using this free service. When I confessed to FBI agent Bill Shore, he surprisingly didn't take any action. He told me that the FBI wouldn't waste resources on such a case, implying that I hadn't broken any law. This experience led me to realize that if the FBI did take action, it would be challenging to argue that I committed a crime. Moreover, I didn't feel guilty about using this resource. This is the point of all the discussions about war-driving, chalking, and node-stumbling: when you get accustomed to wireless connectivity, it begins to feel like a fundamental right. In the future, we may come to view bandwidth as essential as air, making it absurd to argue that it's illegal.",0

Regarding the storage deals 47472 and 60747, I would like to confirm that we should be using contract number 60747, which is an interruptible storage deal, instead of contract number 47472, which is a firm storage deal. Since the interruptible contract number 60747 aligns with the terms of the deal, I recommend discontinuing deal 47472 going forward. Please let me know if this is a problem or if we need to take further action.

Are there any reasons not to use the new apt releases on RH 7.x?

Upon considering the new apt releases, I'm having trouble finding any drawbacks. My main concern, however, is that when rebuilding packages for Psyche on Valhalla, I would need to adjust the ""Release:"" tag to ensure upgrade compatibility. This would complicate my CVS repository, which is hosted on my Valhalla box. 

I understand there are workarounds for this issue, but the simplest solution for me would be to wait until I upgrade my primary machine to Psyche and have Valhalla on a secondary rebuild system.

"I would like to request that you set up a delivery deal for Meter 8740 for January 2000 and December 1999. Upon reviewing the OSS, I noticed that there is an operational contract with a swing clause that ensures third-party contracts remain whole, regardless of meter flow. However, on days 12-14, the meter did not generate enough volume to cover the nomination for Western. This issue is also present on January 25. I kindly request that you resolve this matter today, as it is a priority for me and Brenda Herod.

Please set up a new deal for Meter 8740 for December 1999 that ensures third-party transports remain whole. As HPL takes the swing in case of excess flow, I believe we need to have a HPL (D) contract to take the swing in cases where we are short. I would appreciate it if you could let me know if this solution works. I need to settle this matter today.

At the bottom of this email, I've included a list of ""cannot lose"" individuals. These individuals are critical to problem-solving in any system.

I've listed 33 personnel from various groups, including Oracle, SQL Server, and EnronOnline. Some notable mentions include:

"I'm concerned that today's political climate has led to a normalization of aggressive behavior at political rallies. The courts have consistently ruled that there are limits to the first amendment, and I believe this has contributed to the widespread practice of shouting down opponents. Instead of engaging in respectful dialogue, many people have adopted the tactic of drowning out opposing viewpoints. This is not only unproductive but also intimidates those with opposing views from expressing themselves.

It's frustrating that the political system has become so polarized that individuals feel the need to resort to these tactics. I agree that the government, with the help of the courts, has limited our rights as citizens under the first amendment, and this has created a sense of disillusionment among the public.

However, I also believe that cultural shifts play a significant role in this behavior. The rise of social media and the 24-hour news cycle have created an environment where people are more likely to engage in heated discussions and become embroiled in conflict. Unfortunately, this has led to a culture of aggression and disrespect, rather than civil discourse.

It's crucial that we recognize this trend and strive to create a society where our differences are addressed through respectful and constructive dialogue. We must also hold our leaders accountable for promoting a culture of civility",0

When I first discovered the potential for a global market for a certain number of computers, I was reminded of Thomas Watson's words in 1943: ""This has worked for me; I think there is a world market for maybe five computers."" His statement resonated with me, as I too believed that the demand for computers transcended geographical boundaries. The thought of a small yet significant number of computers being in high demand across the globe was both exciting and daunting. 

As I reflect on the words of Pierre Laplace, who famously told Napoleon that his theories on celestial mechanics did not require the involvement of a deity, I am reminded to be cautious when charting my own course. ""You got to be careful if you don't know where you're going,"" as Yogi Berra wisely said, ""because you might not get there."" In a world where uncertainty is ever-present, I must carefully consider my goals and the potential outcomes before embarking on a journey.

I must admit that the prospect of capitalizing on this global demand for computers is both thrilling and intimidating. However, I believe that with careful planning and an open mind, I can successfully navigate the challenges and seize the opportunities that lie ahead.",1

I wanted to reach out to update you on the latest developments at MailPound. When we launched our platform almost two years ago, our primary focus was on providing a resource for travel agents to organize and search supplier special offers, as well as participate in our weekly sweepstakes and fam section. However, as the industry has evolved, we've had to adapt and expand our offerings to better serve travel agents and help them succeed in today's challenging economic climate.

Like many in the retail travel industry, we've faced the cumulative effects of commission cuts, the aftermath of 9/11, and the drop in the stock market. To survive and thrive, we're working harder, smarter, and together. Our focus has shifted from simply providing a resource for searching supplier special offers to offering a suite of tools and services that can create sales and raise commissions.

I want to bring attention to the importance of finding affordable prescription options online. With the rising cost of healthcare, it's essential that we explore cost-effective solutions. 

Our current predicament is a stark reminder of how much we rely on technology to perform tasks efficiently. Similarly, I believe that even though machines can do many things well, they can never replace the emotional intelligence and compassion that humans possess.

I recently came across a quote that resonated deeply with me: ""We should live our lives as though Christ were coming this afternoon."" This quote emphasizes the importance of living life with intention and purpose, rather than putting things off until tomorrow.

In a world that often prioritizes technology over human connection, I believe that love is what brings us together. As the quote mentions, ""love will enter cloaked in friendship's name."" I hope that we can all strive to cultivate a sense of love, compassion, and understanding in our daily interactions.

Let's work together to explore affordable prescription options and cultivate a culture of love and kindness.",1

Dear IonaandR,

I am excited to share an incredible opportunity that could lead to financial success and a more balanced life for you and your family. Our business is not multi-level marketing, and I would like to present you with a few questions to determine if this opportunity is right for you.

Do you already have a home office set up with the necessary equipment, such as a personal computer, fax, and answering machine? If so, this business could be a great fit for you.

Do you have 10-15 hours per week to dedicate to building your own part-time (or full-time) business? If you can commit to this, our system can help you generate a significant cash flow.

Are you comfortable reading from a script and introducing our products with enthusiasm? Our system does all the selling for you, so no cold-calling is required. In fact, prospects will ask you to call them.

With our system, on average, every 15 or 16 calls you make will generate a sale that pays you a commission in excess of $1,100. If you can make that many calls per week (or per day), you can create a substantial income.

If you answered ""yes"" to any of these questions and have integrity,",1

"I recently came across an interesting quote by Chomsky that I would like to discuss. In unclear cases, where the analysis is not immediately apparent, Chomsky suggests that we should ""let the theory choose"" the correct analysis. I was curious to know where he made this statement, and I appreciate the help I received from Jan Odiijk, Barbara Abbott, and Michael Israel.

According to Chomsky, in Syntactic Structures (p. 14), we can establish the goals of grammar by assuming a partial understanding of sentences and non-sentences. This allows us to consider certain phoneme sequences as definitely sentences and others as definitely non-sentences. In cases where the analysis is uncertain, we should allow the grammar to decide, provided it is set up in the simplest way to include clear sentences and exclude clear non-sentences.

With a sufficient number of clear cases, we can establish a criterion of adequacy for any given grammar. I would like to explore this concept further and discuss its implications in more detail.",0

"I wanted to inform you that due to the recent price surge in California, our company has had to adjust its budget for the upcoming project. As you know, we have been planning to launch a new product in the state, and we are now facing higher costs for production materials.

The increase in prices is primarily driven by supply chain disruptions and increased labor costs. We are working closely with our suppliers to negotiate better rates, but in the meantime, we need to adjust our estimates.

Our team has recalculated the project's budget, and we have identified areas where we can make some adjustments. We plan to reduce the scope of certain features and optimize our production process to minimize the impact of the increased costs.

I want to assure you that we are committed to delivering a high-quality product within the original timeline. Our team is working diligently to ensure that the project stays on track, despite the challenges posed by the price surge.

I would like to schedule a meeting with you to discuss the project's budget and timeline in more detail. Please let me know a convenient time for you, and I will arrange the meeting accordingly.",0

Dear valued customer,

I'm writing to bring to your attention the publication of ""The Phonology of Campidanian Sardinian"" by Roberto Bolognesi. This groundbreaking book presents a comprehensive description and theoretical account of the phonological system of Southern Sardinian, a self-organizing structure that is based on three existing theories: the dependency-based approach to segmental structure, metrical prosody, and optimality theory.

The book is divided into ten chapters, covering topics such as sociolinguistic introduction, data presentation, theoretical introduction, and more. It provides a unitary framework that leads to a comprehensive account of the phonological system, from the segmental level to the level of higher prosodic constituents.

A major revision and extension of the three theories are proposed, resulting in a new understanding of the phonological system of Southern Sardinian. The book is an essential read for anyone interested in phonology, linguistics, and language theory.

If you're interested in purchasing the book, please note that the price for individuals ordering directly from Holland Academic Graphics is NLG 40 (excluding P&P and VAT). You can place your order at their website or contact them directly.

As the entertainment industry launches a campaign against general-purpose computing, major tech companies are reluctantly giving in. Intel, AMD, and Microsoft have all yielded to the pressure, but Apple is taking a different approach. In his recent column, Dan Gillmor highlights Apple's refusal to join the anti-consumer trend. While other companies are moving to limit the flexibility of their products, Apple remains committed to preserving the functionality that users have come to expect.

Intel, AMD, and Microsoft have all signed onto the entertainment industry's efforts to limit the capabilities of their products, effectively restricting the way users can engage with their devices. Apple, on the other hand, has yet to join this movement. In a recent column, Dan Gillmor argues that Apple's stance is a refreshing departure from the anti-consumer stance adopted by other major tech companies.

Gillmor references a recent article in the Silicon Valley Business Journal, which notes the trend towards restricting the capabilities of consumer products. He also points to a discussion forum where users are sharing their concerns about the implications of this trend.

In contrast, Apple is taking a more user-centric approach. By refusing to yield to the pressure from the entertainment industry, Apple is demonstrating its commitment to preserving the flexibility and functionality of its products.

"I am compelled to write and express my thoughts on a recent observation. It seems that some individuals tend to focus solely on their own interests, neglecting the well-being of those around them. This self-centered approach is, in my opinion, utter nonsense. Who would wish to disregard the concerns of others and prioritize their own needs above all else? I firmly believe in the importance of liberty, but I also recognize that this freedom should not be exercised at the expense of others. It is essential to strike a balance between our personal desires and the needs of those around us.

Academics and scientists have long debated the ethics of genetic engineering. While some may argue that the pursuit of scientific progress is paramount, I believe that we must consider the potential consequences of our actions on society as a whole.

I'm reaching out to inquire about low-cost high-quality software options. As Kathy Clara mentioned, it's essential to find reliable and efficient tools without breaking the bank. I understand that many people are on a tight budget, but it's crucial to invest in software that meets our needs.

In our quest for affordable solutions, we often come across software that may not meet our expectations. However, there are some great alternatives that offer excellent quality at a lower price. For instance, some software developers offer discounts for students, non-profits, or small businesses.

It's also essential to consider the long-term costs of software. While an initial low-cost option may seem appealing, it's crucial to think about the potential costs of maintenance, updates, and support.

If you know of any affordable and high-quality software options, please let me know. I'd appreciate any recommendations or insights you can share.

"I understand that the activists on the train refused to pay for food and other items they acquired from Muslim vendors, then taunted them. This action is not only unfair but also dangerous, as it can put the lives of these vendors and their families at risk.

In India, the margin of survival is very thin, and denying someone food can be equivalent to stealing from them. The activists' behavior can be seen as a direct act of violence intended to cause suffering and even death.

I agree that the response from the Muslim vendors was extreme, but I can understand why they felt the need to take drastic action after being taunted and not being paid for their goods. Their actions, while unjustifiable, can be seen as a reaction to the unjust treatment they received.

It's important to remember that there are two sides to every story, and we must try to understand the perspectives of all parties involved. I hope that in the future, we can work towards a society where such conflicts can be resolved peacefully.",0

In 1957, a group of monks in Thailand discovered a fascinating secret while relocating a giant clay Buddha. As they carefully examined the idol, one monk noticed a crack in the Buddha and wisely decided to wait a day before proceeding. During the night, one of the monks, intrigued by the crack, used his flashlight to inspect the area. To his surprise, he found something reflected back at him, prompting him to chip away at the clay. As the clay was removed, the Buddha's luminosity increased, revealing a magnificent solid-gold statue. Many historians believe that the Buddha had been covered with clay to protect it from the Burmese army's attack, which resulted in the monks' deaths. This story serves as a powerful metaphor for our own lives. Just as the Buddha's true value was hidden beneath a layer of clay, we too often conceal our inner worth beneath a disguise of insecurity, fear, or external influences.

Similarly, many individuals are unaware of the financial treasures hidden within their current income. Like the Buddha, their true potential remains buried beneath a layer of financial misconceptions, debt, and poor financial habits. It's time to unearth the gold within our means.

I understand what you're saying, Eirikur. You've used neuro-conditioning to help children cope with stressful situations. The idea is to evoke a desired mental state, then associate it with a specific stimulus. In your example, you'd use a gentle shoulder pinch to recreate the state.

When faced with an uncomfortable situation, the children could recall the earlier state by triggering the pinch. While it's not a perfect solution, it has an undeniable effect. This concept might explain why some individuals, like Bob Dylan, rely on specific superstitions or rituals to perform better. The cue provides a link to a more relaxed mental state, which ultimately enhances their performance.",0

"Electricity trading continued to move online in the past six months, but most wholesale power deals are still being done through traditional voice brokerages, according to the latest Energy Argus survey. The survey found that internet-based trading now accounts for 38% of trading in the US, up from 28.5% in February and 25% in April 2000. However, this growth in online trading does not necessarily translate to increased market share, as most online trades are being completed through either OR EnronOnline, each of which has more than a third of the electronic market.

While internet-based trading has gained traction, traditional brokers still lead in processing most power trades due to their ability to offer options and other derivatives, as well as their dominance in the short-term physical markets. Additionally, some trading houses remain hesitant to adopt online technology.

The survey, which polled 40 power traders, highlights the evolving landscape of the power industry, with online trading expected to continue its growth trajectory. However, traditional brokers will likely remain a significant force in the market for the foreseeable future.",0

"Here's an update on the bazaar-style interop initiative. Our recent discussion has led to several key decisions, which I'll outline below. 

The first important conclusion is that our primary goal is to develop a shared understanding among developers of the current state of affairs in the ""interop landscape"". This requires a comprehensive, accurate, and up-to-date documentation of existing interoperability solutions. To facilitate this, we're proposing the development of a shared wiki, which would allow contributors to pool their knowledge and experiences. 

Another key aspect is the identification of specific, high-priority areas for interop development. Based on our current understanding, these areas include web services, device and system APIs, and file formats. We're eager to hear from developers who have experience in these areas and would be willing to help shape the direction of our initiative. 

Additionally, we're planning to set up regular collaboration meetings to facilitate knowledge sharing and progress updates. These meetings would provide an opportunity for developers to get involved and contribute to the development of interop solutions. 

Overall, our aim is to create a dynamic, community-driven platform for developers to come together, share ideas, and collaborate on developing innovative interop solutions. If you're interested in participating or learning more, please don",0

"Hi Sunil,

Congratulations on setting up maildrop with virtual users! Integrating Razor with maildrop is a great way to test its filtering capabilities. Although I couldn't find similar documentation for maildrop, you can use the following recipe as a starting point.

I used to run Vipul's Razor check # log `/usr/bin/razor-check` log ""razor-check = $RETURNCODE"" if ($RETURNCODE == 0) {   xfilter ""reformail -a 'X-Razor: SPAM'""   log ""SPAM caught by Vipul's Razor""   to ""$FOLDERS/.SPAM/"" } With Razor version 1, I had issues with false positives. I now use SpamAssassin with Razor2, which catches more spam that Razor alone. After whitelisting my newsletters, SpamAssassin with Razor2 does a great job.

You can remove the log statements once you're running. I use both Razor and SpamAssassin, as SpamAssassin catches spam that Razor doesn't.

Hope this helps!

Dear all,

Ronan Waide asked whether there's a practical use for hard links, considering soft links could achieve the same goal. He's genuinely seeking insight into the benefits that others may see. I'd like to share some historical context.

Hard links were implemented by the Bell Labs Unix team, whereas soft links were introduced by Berkeley's Bill Joy and colleagues, about five years later. Soft links were designed to overcome cross-device hard linking limitations. Although they fulfilled their purpose, they can be fragile and break easily, as seen in cases where the target file is deleted.

In contrast, hard links were designed to provide a more robust solution. However, it's worth noting that the MacOS offers a better design for similar concepts.

I'd love to hear any insights or practical examples of hard links' benefits that others may be aware of.

I wanted to share an update regarding the negotiated rate deals with you. Maria called me earlier today to inform us that the deal is now on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) agenda for Wednesday, March 28. The agenda includes an order on the negotiated rate deals, which we had previously negotiated with the relevant parties.

Please note that this is a good opportunity for us to review and finalize the terms of the deal before the FERC order is issued. I recommend that we review the deal's key terms, including any clauses related to the negotiated rate, to ensure that we're satisfied with the agreement.

If you have any questions or concerns about the deal, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I'm available to discuss this further and ensure that we're prepared for the upcoming FERC order.

"I'm still not satisfied with the Muppet selection. While Kermit is a classic choice, I'd prefer to be Rizzo the Rat. He's always been the coolest and most charming Muppet to me. Perhaps it's his wit and sarcastic comments that I find so endearing.

I'm still curious, though, how you came to the conclusion that Kermit is the best Muppet. Was there something specific that made you choose him? I'd love to hear your thoughts on the matter.

Looking forward to hearing back from you.

"Dear All,
I'm surprised to learn that many website designers are unaware that webforms can accept ""U.S. of A"" as a country, or multiple/free-form telephone numbers, and even be partitioned into manageable steps. Unfortunately, many designers create bad webforms that are not user-friendly, and this is a result of poor design and testing. The concept of ""best practices"" is still evolving, and it's essential to recognize that a well-designed webform is not just about aesthetics, but also about usability and accessibility.

I'm amazed that, even with the existence of XForms and XHTML, many people still use outdated webform designs. It's essential to keep up with the latest developments and adjust our designs accordingly. If a piece of software had a security warning five years ago, wouldn't you have updated it by now?

I believe it's the business's responsibility to prioritize webform design and testing, as they are the ones responsible for creating user-friendly experiences. The bottom line is that, if a bridge (webform) is broken, it's the business's fault, regardless of whose fault it is.

Sincerely,

It seems that the odd number prerelease, even number stable release numbering convention makes sense. Instead of having separate releases like 0.61pre2 and 0.61final, we could stick with 0.61 as the main version and have different release tags like 0.61-1, 0.61-2, 0.62. This would simplify the naming convention and avoid confusion. 

For example, as Matthias Saou has done with xmame, we can package 0.61 prereleases as ""0.61-fr0.x"" since the source code lacks pre-version tags. This approach would be more coherent and easier to understand.

After successfully implementing the ""catchup unseen messages before cur"" procedure, I'm excited to share the code with the Exmh community. This procedure, initially inspired by John R. LoVerso, uses Tcl to automatically mark unseen messages as read up to the current message. The code, which you can add to your.tk/exmh directory, has been tested and is ready for use.

To utilize this feature, you'll need to add the following lines to your.exmh/exmh-defaults file:

*Fops.more.m.l_ketchup:         Catch-up all before current

The textbook ""An Introduction to Japanese Linguistics"" by Tsujimura (1996) is the first comprehensive book on the structure of Japanese written in the framework of generative linguistics. This book serves as both an introduction to Japanese linguistics for those without prior knowledge and a reference for linguists. It covers phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, language change, dialect variation, and gender differences, introducing linguistic notions and terminology and analyzing theoretical perspectives.

The book focuses on phonology and syntax, employing the formal approach of generative grammar. Additionally, ""A Comprehensive Spanish Grammar"" by De Bruyne and Pountain (1995) offers a detailed exploration of the Spanish language, covering topics from pronunciation to specific challenges, such as verbs and word order. This book includes sections on regional diversity and Latin American Spanish.

Lastly, ""Drills in Arabic Writing & Pronunciation as a Foreign/Second Language"" by Dr. Jassem et al.

Dear Valued Shippers,

Kern River Pipeline is announcing an open season to gauge interest in year-round firm transportation (FT) services to Nevada and California, as well as interest in capacity relinquishment by existing firm shippers. Our pipeline is positioned to offer significantly reduced FT rates, thanks to recent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approval of our Extended Term Rate Program (ET Program). Under the ET Program, customers could benefit from a rate reduction of approximately $0.22 per decatherm (DTH) over a 15-year contract. Additionally, our system expansion plans can reduce overall rolled-in rates for all shippers.

The proposed mainline expansion of up to 500 million cubic feet per day (MMCF/D) is targeted for in-service by May 1, 2002. If goals are met using relinquished capacity and no new facilities are required, new service could begin as early as October 1, 2001. For more information, please contact Laurie Brown at (801) 584-6410 or Greg Snow at (801) 7270.

I understand your frustration and skepticism when it comes to companies' practices, particularly when it comes to handling small refunds. You received a check from Pac Bell (now SBC) for a mere $0.33, which is significantly less than the cost they incurred in preparing and mailing the check. You question whether this is a cost-effective approach and whether it's worth framing the check, burning it, or cashing it in.

I agree that there's a strong case for reconsidering this practice. Instead of issuing refunds, companies could save costs by skipping the refund process altogether and reducing their surcharges for promoting services. This would seem to be a more logical approach, especially considering the millions of customers these companies serve. The issue at hand is not just about the $0.33, but about the underlying principle of over-billing and the subsequent costs incurred.

Your skepticism is well-founded, and it's crucial to keep in mind that companies are driven by profit motives. In this case, Pac Bell's actions seem more focused on demonstrating compliance with legal requirements rather than providing a reasonable service to customers.

I agree with Tom that this kind of thinking is misguided. It's important to recognize that both heterosexual and homosexual individuals can be promiscuous, and that promiscuity is not unique to any one sexual orientation. Additionally, it's crucial to note that the issue of virus load is unrelated to the fact that some people are more promiscuous than others.

What I would like to highlight is that there is a specific subpopulation outside of the sex industry that has historically been extremely promiscuous, with an incidence rate that is two orders of magnitude higher than the average. This subpopulation has been previously overlooked in discussions about promiscuity and its implications.

I would encourage everyone to think critically about these issues and consider the complexities involved. Let's switch on our brains and examine the facts objectively, rather than making generalizations based on incomplete information.

I wanted to share some key points regarding Deacero's credit situation. At present, hedging this name for any duration beyond 5 years is extremely challenging. Insurance companies are willing to provide protection, but they'll take a 10% first loss, and proof of loss must be proven for the payout to be valid.

Regarding Zurich's offering, I recommend using it to cover the first $35 million of the $65 million exposure at the front end. This is the cheapest alternative, but it comes with certain constraints, such as timely payments and proof of loss. Additionally, Deacero needs to obtain a BB or better private rating from ENE.

EnronCredit can offer protection for the excess exposure above the insurance coverage. We can provide failure-to-pay and bankruptcy coverage for Deacero. Our offer includes a 2- or 3-year rolling tranche format, with the option to buy protection for the entire duration (15 years NPV) at 3.5% or for a cash settlement (with a payout equal to 100% minus recovery).

We can structure the tranche on an accreting or amortizing basis to suit either the predicted 95% exposure or the actual exposure. We can also make payments digital,",0

As the retail industry continues to evolve, it's crucial to ensure our barcodes keep pace with the growing demand for accuracy and efficiency. The recent development of 13- and 14-digit extensions is an attempt to bridge this gap, but I believe we're overlooking the bigger picture. Instead of incrementally increasing the number of digits, we should be designing barcodes that can accommodate larger data sets.

The Universal Code Council and EAN International advocate for moving to 14-digit codes, citing the need for additional space to store data like batch and lot numbers. However, I'm skeptical of the value this patented innovation brings. A more effective solution would be to transition to two-dimensional barcodes, which could not only increase data storage capacity but also ease the transition to radio-transponder tags.

For a comprehensive overview of different barcode standards, including two-dimensional variants, I recommend visiting [www.makebarcode.com/specs/speclist.html](http://www.makebarcode.com/specs/speclist.html). The Xerox Dataglyph is an excellent example of a two-dimensional barcode that could revolutionize the way we store and retrieve data.

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has approved several new HTML ""emotitags"" that are designed to elicit strong emotional responses from readers. These tags have no physical effect, but rather aim to provoke feelings of anger, sadness, or self-indulgence.

One of the newly approved tags is the ""War on Terror"" symbol, which is intended to be used when reporting on sensitive topics, such as the Iraq War. When used, this tag is expected to induce violent anger towards the subject of the reporting, as seen in the example: ""Iraqi leader Sadaam Hussein has adopted the African dictatorial habit of eating his political opponents.""

The ""I'm hurting too"" tag is designed for use when reporting on the death of famous people, such as the Queen Mother.

"I'm writing to inquire about the diachronic development of certain grammatical markers in various Chinese languages. Specifically, I'm interested in the evolution of [de], [ge], [ge], [e], [kai], and [ge] in Mandarin, Shanghainese, Hokkien, Teochew, and Cantonese.

I'm seeking to understand which markers are historically or etymologically related, potentially deriving from a common source. For instance, are [de] and [dik] in Mandarin and Cantonese, respectively, diachronically related?

Additionally, I'd like to explore the cases of [e] and [kai] in Hokkien and Teochew, which exhibit accidental homophony with [de] and [ge] in Mandarin. Are [e] and [kai] the products of diachronic coalescence of distinct forms at an earlier stage of the language, or are there synchronic arguments for positing two distinct lexical items?

As a general linguist, I don't read or speak Chinese, and I'd appreciate any insights, references, or summaries of published works addressing these questions. Your views or guidance would be greatly appreciated.",0

"As we discuss the rules for our SpamAssassin system, I'd like to propose a reality check. Let's examine the headers of incoming emails more closely. While it's tempting to pack headers with multiple details to gain negative points, we should ensure that these combinations make sense together.

For instance, can we have a Pine message ID alongside an Outlook Express User-Agent in the same header? With meta rules, which were introduced in version 2.40, we can now check for Outlook-style forwarded messages and adjust our scoring system accordingly.

I believe the headers should receive special attention. Although the content of a message from a reputable source like the NY Times or Lockergnome might appear spammy, the headers typically don't contain forged or faked information. Let's tone down the negative scores and award extra points for obvious forgeries.

When we gather more reliable ""nice"" tests, the Global Accuracy (GA) system will assign lower scores to them. Currently, there are few good ""nice"" tests in the rulebase, and many positive tests that newsletters trigger, posing a challenge for the GA to solve.

I am following up on our discussions regarding clustering for gas and power. I would greatly appreciate it if you could provide us with the list of Enron's curves by geographical region, separately for gas and power.

We will work closely with Risk Control to finalize these steps.

Dear linguistics enthusiasts,

I'm thrilled to share with you a collection of significant dates in the month of May that have shaped our understanding of language. From ancient times to modern discoveries, these dates are a testament to the fascinating evolution of linguistics.

On May 2, 1919, Baudouin de Courtenay conceded defeat in his bid for the presidency of Poland. Meanwhile, on May 3, 1955, Mouton & Co. discovered how American libraries order books and inadvertently started a series of books on linguistics instead of limericks.

May 5, 1403, marks the beginning of the Great English Vowel Shift, while Giles of Tottingham, a 14th-century resident, mistook a pub sign, asking for ale, only to be confused by the barmaid's response.

On May 6, 1939, the University of Chicago traded Leonard Bloomfield to Yale University for two janitors and an undisclosed number of concrete gargoyles. This unusual exchange highlights the power dynamics in academia.

In Secaucus, New Jersey, on May 7, 1966, researchers observed the R-less pronunciation in eight kindergarten pupils, which sparked a government response by stationing National Guardsmen",0

One important aspect of the SAP integration is timekeeping. Although it may seem mundane at first glance, it is a vital component of the system. Time entry and coding populate not just payroll, but also projects and cost centers in real-time. This flexibility allows us to charge employee and contractor time to the areas they actually work in, which is customizable by business unit, company, or cost center.

To make this work as intended on July 1st, each organizational unit (cost center) needs to clarify the following questions:

1. Will contractors be required to enter time in SAP?
2. Will we use positive timekeeping (specifying cost centers or projects worked on) or ""exceptions"" only?
3. Is an approval process desired, and if so, what is it?
4. Will people use the self-service capability or rely on a timekeeper?

Dear Sir/Madam,

I'd like to reconnect with you and explore new ideas since our last meeting. I've been reflecting on our conversation, and I've come to realize that true innovation comes from embracing the uncertainty and complexity of the world. You mentioned the importance of being brutally honest, and I agree that authenticity is key to building meaningful relationships.

"As a job seeker, I've been observing a concerning trend lately. It seems that hiring managers are now prioritizing family and extended family members for job openings, making it increasingly difficult for others to get their resumes looked at. The job posting sites are now largely empty, with many positions being months old. This makes the practice of posting ""resume bait"" jobs almost pointless.

The unemployment rates are steady, but only because people are dropping out of the workforce after an extended period of joblessness. The number of people not in the labor force is rising by 400,000 a month. International numbers are not faring any better, as technology is increasingly replacing human workers.

Grad school programs are overflowing with students for non-tech majors, and colleges are struggling to accommodate the influx of ""day-job refugees."" The proliferation of work-at-home scams and resume services in spam emails is also a concerning sign.

I urge job seekers to be cautious and prepared in this challenging job market. It's essential to adapt to the changing landscape and be proactive in finding alternative opportunities.",0

Are you considering trying Ciallis for the first time? I wanted to highlight some of the benefits you can expect from this product. Unlike other ED treatments, Ciallis can provide a prolonged and reliable erection, lasting for 36 hours. This means you can take control of your sexual experiences and enjoy a longer period of intimacy.

One of the key advantages Ciallis offers over other ED treatments, such as Viagra, is its speed of action. You can expect to start feeling the effects within just 10 minutes of taking the medication. Additionally, Ciallis can be used in conjunction with alcohol, making it an attractive option for those who enjoy socializing with friends.

It's also worth noting that Ciallis can be shipped to any country, making it easily accessible. If you're interested in trying Ciallis, I encourage you to take the first step today. You can visit our website to learn more and place an order.

"Noting the French officer's upcoming attempt to break the highest free fall record, I'd like to ask: what's the hurry? The normal terminal velocity is much slower. However, the record-breaker will be jumping from 40,000 meters, where atmospheric conditions are quite different. The article I found on Wired News (http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,53928,00.html) highlights the dangers of this endeavor. It's worth noting that the last person to attempt this feat died due to equipment failure.

Further research reveals that the jumper will be breaking the sound barrier at 35,000 meters and likely reaching top speed above 30,000 meters. It's surprising that he's taking this risk, considering the risks involved.

I couldn't help but wonder if his attempt will qualify him for the Darwin Awards if he doesn't make it. The phrase ""French people..."" seems rather... interesting. Nevertheless, I hope Michel Fournier's attempt is successful and he avoids any, ahem, ""French"" mishaps.

"Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to bring to your attention the importance of being cautious when considering purchasing products that claim to enhance penis size. With the increasing popularity of such products, it's essential to be aware of the potential risks and side effects.

As you may know, there are various claims and dogmatic beliefs about what works best for individuals. However, I believe that freedom and independence are crucial in making informed decisions. Rather than blindly following advice or opinions, I encourage you to think critically and make up your own mind.

I'd like to emphasize that there is no one-size-fits-all solution, and what works for one person may not work for another. It's essential to consider your individual needs and circumstances before making a decision.

In conclusion, I believe that opinions are ultimately shaped by our emotions and feelings rather than our intellect. I encourage you to be mindful of this and make informed decisions that align with your values and goals.

I was mistaken about Hernando DeSoto's arrival in Florida. Since DeSoto was born around 1500 and Cortez arrived in 1519, it's unlikely that DeSoto was the one who landed in Southern Florida. If it wasn't DeSoto, who was it that encountered the mound-dwellers, only to find that they had vanished by the time Cortez arrived?

This mystery still intrigues me, and I'd love to learn more about the explorer who preceded Cortez in Florida. Perhaps you, Robert, or someone else in the fork mailing list can shed some light on this historical enigma.

Hi folks,
I'm writing to inform you that after upgrading the kernel on one of my home machines from 2.2.18pre21 to 2.4.19, I'm experiencing an issue with my network card. Specifically, I'm getting two interfaces, eth0 and eth1, instead of the usual eth0. Additionally, packets can't come in, although packets can be sent out.

I've noticed that the 3c509 module is loading, but it's being loaded with a different IRQ (5 and 10) compared to the previous kernel version (IRQ 10). I've tried disabling the 3c509 module and loading it manually, but it still loads with the incorrect IRQ.

Anyone have any suggestions on what might be causing this issue, which seems to be specific to kernel 2.4? I'm running a Debian 3.0 distro, and the hardware and BIOS seem to be fine, as it works correctly when booted to kernel 2.2.

Thanks,

"Dear Garrick,

Regarding the Tenaska IV issue, I'd like to revisit the discussion about Ena's ability to manage the plant's positions. As you know, we are unable to reach an agreement via phone. I'd appreciate it if you could recommend an alternative party who could assume the same terms under Ena's management. However, I must emphasize that the equity owners are already in talks with a buyer interested in the asset, so the arrangement would likely be short-term.

Regarding point (2), did your discussions with Legal lead to any conclusions regarding compensation for the project? Can you also clarify the amount of the claim the project has against Ena? I agree that the project should make direct payments to suppliers and Lone Star. I'm available to discuss further and would appreciate a call if possible.

Please let me know how we can proceed with the fuel management, considering Ena's financial situation and the uncertainty surrounding Enron's ownership in the plant.

"I understand that you are discussing the optimization of a code fragment in C. Your initial code uses the `strlen` function, which can be expensive. I agree that in C++, `string.length()` can be declared `const` to optimize the operation, but this is not possible in C.

You have suggested alternative approaches, including using a loop with a variable length calculated using `strlen` and using pointer arithmetic to iterate over a null-terminated string. The latter approach is interesting, as it avoids the need for array manipulation and takes advantage of the fact that C strings are null-terminated.

However, you also mention that this approach uses pointer arithmetic, which can make the code less readable if not managed carefully. I understand your preference for using Java for most programming tasks, as it can simplify many programming tasks and provide better memory management.

Overall, the goal is to optimize the code while keeping it readable and maintainable. If the `strlen` function is indeed the bottleneck, then the alternative approaches you suggested could be considered.",0

Are you suggesting that the reliability of a programming language depends on the skill level of its developers rather than its intrinsic properties? Your example of two programmers with different coding styles and productivity levels highlights the importance of considering the human factor in software development. You're implying that choosing the right language for a project ultimately depends on the capabilities of the team involved, regardless of the language's reputation for reliability.

I agree that this is a crucial aspect to consider, as even the most robust language can produce faulty code if used by an inexperienced developer. This perspective underscores the need for continuous learning, experimentation, and improvement in the development process.

Your humorous tone and relatable example have effectively conveyed this point. By highlighting the role of human factors in software development, you've reminded us that the effectiveness of a language is not solely determined by its internal characteristics, but also by the expertise and experience of the people using it.

Well-written code is essential, regardless of the language. Your witty remark serves as a valuable reminder that developers should focus on writing clean, maintainable code, regardless of the language used.

Best bang for the buck: the Ford Mustang Cobra, capable of 390 horsepower, can be purchased for $35,000. On a recent outing, I came away with a huge smile, if only the car's design wasn't so unappealing. It's a shame, really, considering Ford's long history of producing...unfortunate-looking vehicles. On the other hand, one can acquire a Honda RSX Type S with 200 horsepower for a mere $23,000. I haven't had the chance to drive an RSX, but based on my experience with late-model Integras, I'm confident that the RSX would leave the Mustang in its dust whenever actual steering wheel movement is required.

The UK Environment Agency has proposed an alarming decision that allows a significant increase in the emissions of a radioactive gas produced in reactors. According to reports, the Agency plans to permit a trebling of these emissions, which has sparked widespread criticism and dismay.

It is imperative that we take immediate action to address this issue and ensure that our environment is protected for future generations.

"I strongly believe that anyone who interrupts a speaker or creates a disturbance that interferes with their message is morally wrong. This behavior is not acceptable, regardless of the political views of the speaker or the protesters. It's essential to recognize that the goal of public discourse is to engage in respectful dialogue, not to disrupt or silence others.

In the context of the recent Rumsfeld event, I find it astonishing that some individuals would resort to such tactics. It's not only disrespectful but also damaging to the overall integrity of the conversation. Instead, we should strive for a more constructive exchange of ideas, even if we don't agree.

Furthermore, I find it troubling that some individuals might argue that it's acceptable to disrupt a speaker if it garners attention or achieves their political goal. This attitude is not only misguided but also sends a harmful message about the importance of respect and civility in our public discourse.

I believe that we should strive to promote a culture of constructive engagement, where opposing views are respected and engaged with in a respectful manner. This is essential for maintaining a healthy and vibrant democracy.",0

"I've reviewed the Bugzilla report and gathered some suggestions to enhance the document's formatting. Below are the proposed improvements:

The document should use a consistent use of ""like"" instead of ""just like"", as the latter is an obsolete construct. Also, the document should avoid enclosing tag argument values in both single and double quotes, and opt for a standard format.

It's recommended to add the ""#"" symbol before hex RGB codes for color arguments, and ensure that the RGB code values are always six digits long. Additionally, it's a good practice to use consistent casing for ""onMouseOver"" and similar attributes throughout the document.

As we delve into the intricacies of physics, a debate has emerged regarding its cultural dependence or independence. You've been engaged in a discussion with a physicist who believes that concepts in physics are not created, but rather discovered through observation of the world. He argues that, regardless of the cultural background, the laws of physics would remain unchanged. For instance, he suggests that if physics were developed by the Navaho or Highland Papuan people, the resulting understanding of the physical world would be identical to the Western paradigm.

However, I'd like to challenge this perspective by highlighting the role of language and cultural context in shaping our understanding of physical phenomena. My colleague believes that the absence of a concept in a language would not hinder the development of a corresponding physical understanding, as the physical forces would remain the same, waiting to be observed. I, on the other hand, argue that the lack of a concept would lead to a fundamentally different understanding of the physical world.

To strengthen my case, I'm seeking examples of languages that do not possess a concept equivalent to the physical force. It's essential to consider the possibility that the absence of a concept might influence the development of a particular type of physics. I believe that the cultural and linguistic background plays a significant role in shaping",0

Dear all,

I'd like to share a thought-provoking article on the Slashdot website. The author discusses the concept of happiness, specifically comparing the emotional state of a believer to that of a skeptic. The article suggests that a believer can find happiness in their convictions, even in the face of uncertainty, whereas a skeptic may struggle to find contentment due to their critical nature.

The article also touches on the idea that credulity, or the tendency to believe without question, is a cheap and potentially dangerous quality. This resonates with me, as I believe that skepticism is a vital component of a healthy and informed outlook.

As the Irish Linux Users' Group, I think it's essential for us to cultivate a culture of critical thinking and skepticism. By doing so, we can foster a community that values evidence-based decision-making and open-minded discussion.

I'd like to express my concerns about the alleged news articles I've come across. The article on Pravda mentions Soviet nukes going missing in Ukraine, while an Associated Press report suggests a possible arms deal between Ukraine and Iraq.

"Dear Yannick,

When considering the use of ""trusted hardware"" in protecting data, it's essential to weigh the costs against the benefits. In many cases, the added security measures may not be worth the expense. A good example of this is the CSS encryption used in DVDs. The encryption key was eventually reverse-engineered by crackers, who simply re-created a software player that bypassed the encryption.

Similarly, smart cards, which contain their own processing unit and encryption capabilities, may not provide the level of security needed for certain applications. While they do perform self-encryption, it's unclear whether they can be used to decrypt data required by the system. If the input data is modified, a smart card could potentially store a record of the data's history.

While this approach may seem feasible, it's essential to consider the potential vulnerabilities in smart card technology. I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on this matter.

"I am writing to bring to your attention a concerning issue with meter 8022, specifically the SCADA feedback from Sitara, which began on January 14th. The feedback indicates excessive flow, exceeding 200 m/day starting from the 15th. This anomaly was brought to my attention by O'Neal this evening, and it has significant implications for our UA 4 number and potentially our P&L.

I have already contacted Lee in Gas Control to ensure that a technician is sent out to investigate and verify the calibration and SCADA feed. I would like to request better estimates from the 14th to the 19th at the earliest opportunity, so we can make necessary corrections to the affected numbers.

Thank you,

Turkic Languages: The First Comprehensive Reference Book in Almost Forty Years
The Turkic languages, edited by Lars Johanson and Eva Agnes Csato, is the first reference book in almost forty years to bring together detailed discussions of the historical development and specialized linguistic structures and features of the languages in the Turkic family. Written by an international team of experts, Turkic languages will be invaluable to students and researchers within linguistics, Turkology, and Near Eastern and Oriental studies.

The uralic languages, edited by Daniel Abondolo, provides a unique survey of individual Uralic languages and sub-groupings. This book gives an overview and then detailed analyses of the Uralic languages, describing their history and development as well as focusing on their linguistic structure. Each chapter is similarly structured, designed for comparative study, including phonology, morphology, syntax, lexicon, and sample text where available. Each chapter includes numerous tables to support and illustrate the text and bibliographies of major references in each language to aid further study.

These books are part of the Routledge Language Family Descriptions series, which provides comprehensive descriptions of the world's major language families. With over 500 and 648 pages, respectively, these volumes offer unparalleled insights into the Turk",0

We are pleased to announce the 24th-26th February 1999 Clitics Workshop at Konstanz University, Germany, in conjunction with the 21st annual meeting of the German Society of Linguistics. Clitics are increasingly prominent in linguistic research, and we invite papers that address the status of clitics in phonology, morphology, and syntax.

In phonology, the incorporation of clitics into prosodic structure remains unclear. Do we distinguish a clitic group in the prosodic hierarchy, or are they part of prosodic words? How do we account for their phonological deficiency?

In morphology, distributed morphology competes with optimality-theoretic solutions for opaque clitics in clitic clusters. What is the best way to capture the order of clitics in these clusters?

Syntactic aspects of clitics are also crucial. For instance, there is no agreement on explaining clitic climbing. Should we account for clitic placement in a syntactic, prosodic, prosodic-syntactic, or optimality-theoretic approach?

Our workshop aims to bring together experts in phonology, morphology, and syntax to share insights and discuss the issues mentioned above. We invite submissions for 30-minute presentations and 1-hour presentations with",0

I'd like to express my concern regarding the Habeus rule, specifically the negative score and its potential to compromise email security. In my opinion, allowing this rule to stand opens a backdoor to spammer's defenses, making it easier for them to evade detection.

From a practical standpoint, if I were a spammer, I would set up a server, send out spam emails with the Habeus headers, and then reconfigure the server and reconnect to a different IP once I've been reported. As long as no one can link my server to the websites my spam directs users to, I'd be in the clear.

I've reported this issue here: http://www.hughes-family.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=762. The problem is unique to Habeus, as other Real-time Blacklist (RBL) systems have a negative header rule with a -20 score that can't be forged.

I fail to see the benefit of making it easier for spam to get through, especially when using SpamAssassin doesn't result in lost emails. My primary concerns include the magnitude of the negative score, which wasn't determined empirically, and the fact that it was added after the rules freeze, without prior discussion.

I appreciate your update, especially your point 3, which aligns with our own discussions yesterday. To clarify, I'd like to address the responsibilities for the maintenance and administration of VAR. We need transparency around the process to ensure that mapping decisions, such as those made yesterday, are easily made, supported, and reviewed.

After last Friday's events, it became clear that our current approach to handling VAR is problematic, particularly at ""pressure points."" I'm assembling a scope for a ""general overhaul"" of the VAR process, including methods and administration, which I hope we can all support. Be assured of our cooperation.

In this context, I'd like to clarify the discussion we had during the VAR coordination meeting on mapping forward price curves into core locations. We agreed on the following:

1. Winston will investigate the IT side to determine the extent to which we can increase the number of forward price curves simulated as basic (core) curves and assess the impact on the time required to complete the VAR run.
2. We should model the curves associated with the biggest 10-20 positions in each commodity as core curves, monitoring the biggest risks separately to avoid aggregating them into less transparent aggregates.

"When considering the history of capitalization in English, it's interesting to note that at least two Germanic languages, Dutch and Standard German, use capitalized pronoun forms for polite second-person use. In Dutch, the word ""u"" is used, while in German, it's ""sie."" This usage is likely linked to a sense of respect, similar to the capitalization of pronominal references to deity. However, in modern Netherlands Dutch, this practice is declining, and ""u"" is used in a more general sense, whereas in Belgian Dutch (Flemish), it seems to be retained more widely. Interestingly, in Belgium, people use ""u"" with each other, often without intending to be overly polite. In contrast, in England, the capitalized ""I"" is likely a typographical convention, rather than an expression of respect, as lower-case ""i"" can be quite small. Paul Werth",0

"Hi all,

I wanted to share an exciting new feature in the development snapshot of PuTTY: built-in proxy support. This allows users to connect to external hosts using SSH via a HTTP proxy. Squid and other good HTTP proxies typically only allow connections to port 443, so the SSH daemon needs to listen on this port. PuTTY's proxy support is still a bit flaky, but it's available.

I've experimented with SOCKS proxy support, but it's not stable yet. Another option is using netcat, which can establish raw connections and send keepalives to prevent session timeout.

Here's a sample function to use netcat for HTTP proxy tunneling:

```
http_proxy_tunnel() {
  mkfifo in.fifo
  (echo ""CONNECT $1:$2 HTTP/1.1""; echo ""HOST: $1:$2""; echo ""HTTP/1.1""; echo; cat in.fifo) | nc myproxy 3128 | (read; read; nc -lp < in.fifo)
}
```

This function assumes you have Bash, and you can use it with Cygwin or natively. Another option is using OpenSSH, which has excellent proxy configuration options.

Recently, there have been two references to a genre called ""Japanese tentacle porn,"" which I must admit, I'm unfamiliar with.

If you fail to meet our expectation of delivering king-size products, she's not going to be happy. Specifically, if your product is not 2 meters and 6 centimeters in length, 2 meters and 6 centimeters in width, 2 meters and 6 centimeters in breadth, and 384 grams in weight, you're bound to disappoint her. It seems she's rather particular about the specifications of the products you deliver.

I want to emphasize that it's crucial to meet these exact specifications, so I won't waste my breath on anything less. If you're unwilling to take the initiative to ensure your product meets these requirements, then perhaps you're not the kind of person I'm looking for.

We are updating our process for reimbursing individually billed items such as cell phones, pagers, and other expenses. Due to the increased use of these items, our Accounts Payable department has seen a significant rise in the number of invoices and vendors. To maintain a timely payment cycle, we have reviewed our processes and would like to introduce a change.

While we encourage vendors to address their invoices to individual employees, we often receive invoices without the employee's name. This can lead to delays in processing the invoices, as we try to track down the employee responsible for the expense. To reduce the time spent on research and forwarding invoices, we request that employees with individually billed items pay for them personally and submit their expenses through employee expense reports.

This change will not only reduce the time spent on research and forwarding invoices but also decrease the number of checks generated by Treasury, the number of vendors in our database, and the turnaround time for payment of invoices. We are currently implementing a web-based expense reporting system, similar to what Enron International has used for the past year, which will make it even easier to file your expense report and receive quick reimbursement.

We would like to implement this change effective immediately. If you have any questions or suggestions, please contact the Accounts Pay",0

If you need to store a database password, a clear first step is to store the password outside the web tree. This can be done by encrypting the password and storing the encryption key in a separate location, requiring an attacker to obtain two distinct pieces of information. Furthermore, it is recommended to create a user account with limited access, rather than granting full privileges.

For enhanced security, consider creating a dedicated program that holds the database keys and allows the web program to interact with IT through a restricted protocol. This program can be designed to only perform necessary operations, adding specific operations as needed. Although this approach may incur a performance hit, it improves data isolation.",0

As game developers strive to innovate and perfect established genres, the trend of licensing physics engines has become increasingly essential. However, it's crucial to recognize that physics engines serve a purpose that goes beyond merely knocking over objects. The interface between your game and a physics engine must be highly sophisticated to fully utilize advanced features.

By embracing the concept of licensing physics engines, game developers can unlock a world of creative possibilities and push the boundaries of what's considered standard gameplay. The intricate interface required to harness the advanced functionality of a physics engine is a testament to the complexity and depth that such a collaboration can provide.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to you in a confidential capacity as the Chairman of the Contract Review Committee of the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA). I am reaching out to you with an extraordinary proposal that requires your cooperation.

Recently, our committee has uncovered an unclaimed contract entitlement with the Central Bank of Nigeria amounting to USD 71,500,000. This sum is an over-invoice contract payment currently held in an offshore account. To facilitate the withdrawal of this fund, we require a partner to assume the role of the contractor who has executed the contract.

In exchange for your assistance, we propose a sharing ratio of 1.70% for our committee, 2.20% for you as the partner, and 10% for expenses incurred during the transaction. This arrangement is necessary due to the fact that, as civil servants, we are prohibited from operating foreign accounts.

If you are interested in this proposal, please respond promptly with the following information:

1. The name you wish to use as the beneficiary of the fund
2. Your confidential phone and fax numbers

Further discussions will focus on the transfer of the funds and provide details on how to accomplish this opportunity.

Thank you for considering our proposal. Best regards,
George Osawa",1

Dear recipient,

I'd like to clarify the purpose and intentions behind the Banned CD. As the sender, I've been receiving messages claiming that my activities are contributing to the moral decay of society. However, I firmly believe that the CD's unique content provides valuable information that can empower individuals to make informed decisions.

The CD offers insights and tools to help people track down old acquaintances, uncover information about their bosses, and even build a new identity. I understand that this may not align with the interests of certain authorities, who have threatened me with legal action to stop selling the CD. Nonetheless, I believe that individuals have the right to access this type of information, and I'm committed to ensuring their freedom to make informed choices.

The CD offers a range of tools, including fake diplomas, identity-building strategies, and methods to avoid debt collectors, lawsuits, and other forms of pressure. I believe that this information can provide a sense of liberation and empowerment, especially for those who are seeking to take control of their lives.

If you're interested in learning more about the Banned CD and its capabilities, I invite you to explore the provided URL for more information.

"Dear Benji,

I've been enjoying the discussion about words that are their own opposites, and I'd like to contribute my thoughts on the matter. Initially, I thought examples like Latin ""altus"" (meaning ""high"" or ""deep"") might fit the bill. However, I realized that it's merely a matter of perspective (e.g., when cleaning an empty swimming pool, ""deep"" becomes ""high""). I decided to look into it further and noticed it wasn't on the list.

One example that I've long pondered is the word ""risk."" In the context of a game, someone ""risked winning"" the game. Yet, I was startled (as a teenager) to see ""he risked losing the game"" in print, as I previously thought the complement of risk was the desirable outcome, not the undesirable one.

I'd love to hear if others have had a similar reaction or any thoughts on what's occurring in the case of ""risk."" It's fascinating to explore how our understanding of certain words can shift over time.

"In an effort to clarify a previous query, I would like to rephrase my question: Who is credited with the idea that analogical change cannot introduce new phonemic contrasts into a language? I was initially directed to a paper by Z. Stieber, written in Polish in the 1930s, but I suspect that this concept has a more extensive history.

After receiving a response from Harry Bochner regarding potential counterexamples, I would like to revisit the topic. It was mentioned that the glottalized /y/ in Navajo is often considered an analogical origin. I have found other reported instances of this phenomenon in the literature, but most seem to be unreliable, such as the examples mentioned by Jakobson (Ukrainian and Belorussian /dzh/) and Moulton and Kiparsky (certain umlauted vowels in Swiss German).",0

Dear fellow, I'd like to express my concerns regarding the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. It's crucial to acknowledge the harm and suffering inflicted upon innocent civilians, regardless of their ethnicity or religion. 

Rather than perpetuating hatred and violence, I suggest we focus on promoting peace and understanding through open dialogue and respectful engagement. We must also recognize the historical injustices and systemic inequalities that have contributed to this cycle of violence.

It's essential to address the root causes of this conflict, including the displacement and marginalization of Palestinians. We must work towards a two-state solution, ensuring the rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their nationality or creed.

I'm appalled by the reports of settlers and Palestinian militants engaging in violence against civilians, including the use of harmful tactics like rat poison. Such actions are morally reprehensible and only serve to further entrench the conflict.

It's crucial that we support diplomatic efforts and engage in constructive discussions to resolve this crisis. We must also acknowledge the suffering and trauma experienced by all parties involved and work towards healing and reconciliation.

I propose that we focus on empowering marginalized communities, promoting economic development, and enhancing education and healthcare infrastructure. This will help alleviate the root causes of this conflict and create a more just and equitable society for",0

Oh Gary, I'm not sure if I'd go so far as to say that the article is 'hate lit' - it's an interesting, albeit a bit troubling theory. While it's not touchy-feely or liberal-friendly, I wouldn't necessarily say it's hate lit. What's troubling about the article is the subtext hate-lit propaganda it presents. The scary thing is that it's not being seen as such. The author's only problem with the article is that it's some of the most alarming hate-lit propaganda they've seen come out of the US since the March of Tears.

"Dear Friends,

I recently stumbled upon a remarkable computer science research paper and wanted to share some fascinating insights with you. The paper introduced me to the concept of a public vertical search portal, specifically http://hpsearch.uni-trier.de/hp, which is a collection of 62,179 computer scientists' home pages. Although many of the pages are broken, I was surprised to find that 50% of the title hits are better than those on DBLP.

What caught my attention was the results from Google's ""Similar Pages"" feature. For instance, the only relevant result is the FoRK Archive page, which sparked my interest. Other similar results included pages on printer toner, home mortgages, and an intriguing concept known as the ""prime radiant."" As it turns out, the prime radiant is an Asimov concept that represents a single, interconnected FoRKlist, connecting decentralized individuals worldwide who share collective wisdom. This collective wisdom is a promising model for predicting the future.

I came across this concept while exploring the homepage of Gregory Alan Bolcer, CTO of Endeavors Technology. I'm interested in exploring this idea further and hope you'll join me in this journey of discovery.

Best regards,
Gregory Alan Bolcer",0

In response to Richard Sproat's question about ""phonemic"" orthography, I would like to clarify that the concept of a ""phonemic"" orthography is virtually non-existent. While language planners may occasionally impose a spelling reform, such as in the cases of Czech or Dutch, these efforts are short-lived, and orthography inevitably diverges from pronunciation as language evolves. It is troublesome that the term ""grapheme"" is often used without a clear understanding of its meaning, particularly in contrast to the more well-defined ""phoneme"".

I have written extensively on this topic, publishing an article in the 18th Lacus Forum (1991) and subsequent discussion in the 21st Lacus Forum (1994). A survey focused on the phonological encoding of writing systems, as requested by R. Sproat, will be available later this year with the publication of ""The World's Writing Systems"", co-edited by myself and William Bright, published by Oxford University Press. The book explores how writing systems encode the phonologies of major languages, and I urge you to take advantage of the pre-publication discount price of $100, available until August 31st.

To: Liam Bedford, Ciaran Mac Lochlainn, Irish Linux Users' Group

I recently discussed the MBR restoration with Liam Bedford and Ciaran Mac Lochlainn. As it turns out, the DOS command 'fdisk /mbr' will restore the MBR, leaving the partitions untouched. However, the Linux equivalent, 'lilo -u /dev/hda,' requires a copy of the MBR in the '/boot' directory, which is not always available.

To clarify, the DOS command 'fdisk /mbr' is not compatible with Linux's fdisk command, which does not have an option for /mbr. Instead, we can use 'lilo -u /dev/hda' (unless John Reilly's suggestion from yesterday is correct). However, this method also requires a copy of the MBR in the '/boot' directory, which was not available during the installation of Linux Mandrake.

I'm grateful for the clarification on the fdisk issue. As a reminder, there is no hidden switch for fdisk. I hope this clears up any confusion.

"As I read through the recent dossier on Saddam Hussein released by the UK government, I couldn't help but notice the inconsistencies and potential flaws in the argument presented by Prime Minister Tony Blair. 

At first glance, the case against Saddam seems airtight, with the government's claims of chemical and biological weapons, as well as connections to terrorism. However, upon closer examination, several key points raise questions regarding the reliability of the information presented. 

For instance, the dossier relies heavily on outdated intelligence, which could be outdated or even fabricated. Furthermore, the alleged connections to terrorism appear to be based on circumstantial evidence rather than concrete proof. 

I'd like to stress that these criticisms are not intended to imply that Saddam Hussein is innocent of any wrongdoing. Instead, it's essential to scrutinize the evidence presented to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the information. 

I'd appreciate any feedback on my analysis, particularly from those familiar with the subject matter.

"Dear fellow astrophysics enthusiasts,

As we continue to unravel the mysteries of the universe, groundbreaking research has shed new light on our understanding of the cosmos. Two significant findings have given us a deeper insight into the workings of the universe, providing what we call ""two new windows on the universe.""

One of these discoveries involves the detection of gravitational waves, which are ripples in the fabric of space-time that were first predicted by Einstein a century ago. This finding has allowed us to glimpse into the universe's early days, witnessing the explosion of stars and the formation of galaxies.

The second breakthrough concerns the observation of fast-moving stars in the distant reaches of the universe. By studying these stars, we've been able to map the universe's evolution over billions of years, gaining invaluable insights into the formation and growth of galaxies.

These findings not only deepen our understanding of the universe but also have far-reaching implications for our understanding of time, space, and the fundamental laws of physics. They also highlight the ongoing importance of astrophysical research in expanding our knowledge of the cosmos.

I invite you to join me in celebrating these incredible advancements and exploring the wonders they hold for our understanding of the universe.

Dear Sir,

I am writing to propose a partnership opportunity that I believe will be of great interest to you. I came across your contact while conducting research for a reliable foreign partner who can assist my family and I in transferring funds to a personal or private account for investment purposes.

I am Mr. Philip Wonyane, the son of the late Mr. John Wonyane, who was the chairman of the farmer's co-operation in Zimbabwe. My father was a prominent figure in Zimbabwe, and after his death, we were forced to leave the country due to the danger posed by the money he kept in his hidden safe. This money, amounting to $13 million, was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and establishment of new farms in Swaziland.

Dear List,

I'm thrilled that you're satisfied with Mail-SpamAssassin's performance in most cases. However, I understand that there are some exceptions, like your situation, where additional effort is required.

To help troubleshoot the issue, I've been debugging the spamc source code by adding printf statements wherever exit code 74 is used. I've attached the modified spamc code for your testing. Please try it out and see if it resolves the problem.

For your reference, here's the output when connecting to the spamc service using telnet:

As John mentioned, I'd like to express my gratitude for your dedication to helping me get SpamAssassin up and running. I'm truly thankful for your assistance.

Dear David,

We have reached an agreement in principle on the changes to the ""standard"" contract form with UBS. We have agreed to the following modifications:

1. The involuntary termination clause will now state that all contracts will be subject to a 90-day notice period, with 99% of the wording agreed upon.

2. The ""free"" option period has been changed from March 15 to March 22, and is now a mutual option with wording agreed upon to 95%.

3. The non-compete clause has been revised to exclude references to Enron and instead focus on Netco and Ena, with 50% of the wording agreed upon.

4. The miscellaneous clause has been changed to specify that the employee representative knows of no claims, grievances, and is now limited to individual matters, with 100% of the wording agreed upon.

5. The recognition of prior Enron service has been added to the contracts, with wording lifted from the offer letter and 100% of the wording agreed upon.

Please note that the contracts will be delayed until the wording is finally signed off by lawyers, which we expect to occur within the next three hours. It is essential that we finalize the changes now, as any further changes will significantly delay",0

"As I understand, you're concerned about the rise of political rallies being disrupted by shouting down speakers who don't agree with the protesters. You believe this is becoming a common practice due to the government and courts limiting First Amendment rights over the years. You argue that this behavior has become acceptable, allowing people to disregard civil discourse and shout down opposing views.

In your opinion, this shouting down is not an effective way to advocate change, as it's not allowing for genuine discussion and debate. You question the intentions of those who engage in this behavior, wondering if they're driven by a desire to be disagreeable or if they're genuinely interested in addressing the issues at hand.

You also mention the restrictions on free speech, citing the need for some limitations on the First Amendment. You believe that the courts have consistently ruled on this, and it's something that's been taught in law school.

"We've received word that deep-fried Twinkies are making a significant impact at county fairs and restaurants across the country. The snack, which consists of the classic Twinkie paired with chocolate or berry sauce and powdered sugar, has become a huge attraction. Vendors are selling thousands of these gooey, calorie-laden treats, with some locations reporting over 26,000 sold in just 18 days.

While the initial reaction to this artery-clogging snack might be excitement, it's essential to consider the health implications. After being deep-fried, a Twinkie contains an estimated 400 calories and 28 grams of fat. This could be the biggest setback for the war on fat since supersized fries, as Americans continue to indulge in these tasty but unhealthy treats.

It's unclear what the long-term effects of this snack trend will be, but it's clear that the demand is high. We'll be keeping a close eye on this development and its potential impact on our health.",0

"Dear colleagues, I would like to share my findings with you, which suggest that randomizing letters in the middle of words has little to no impact on the ability of skilled readers to comprehend the text. This concept is quite easy to demonstrate. For instance, a publication could randomize all letters, keeping the first two and last two letters the same, without significantly affecting readability. My analysis did not produce surprising results because the prevailing theory at the time focused on shape and sentence recognition. Saberi's work suggests that we may have powerful parallel processors at work. The reason for this is that identifying content by parallel processing speeds up recognition. We only need the first and last letters to detect changes in meaning. I'm currently working with an experimental text recognition engine that exhibits similar properties. It can effortlessly read through misspellings like the ones above, as the author suggested, and the pattern matching is inherently parallel internally. If the text recognition algorithm or structure humans use is similar to the one we've been working with, the significance of the first letter (and to a lesser extent, the last letter) is that without it, the text pattern recognition problem becomes exponentially more difficult and requires deeper abstraction analysis. The middle letters are far less important and computationally easier to resolve correctly",0

"Please find attached my quick assessment of the VAR training. I have evaluated the course based on its relevance to the job requirements and overall learning experience.

The assessment highlights both strengths and areas for improvement in the training, including suggestions for enhancing the content, delivery, and effectiveness of the course. I have also provided a rating system to help identify specific aspects that require attention.

In my opinion, the training is well-structured, and the instructor did an excellent job of engaging the participants. However, I suggest that more hands-on activities and real-world examples be incorporated to make the training more practical and applicable to the workplace.

I would like to emphasize that this is an initial assessment, and I believe that further feedback from participants and instructors would be valuable in refining the training. I am happy to discuss my findings with anyone interested and provide additional recommendations.

It's likely that linguistics tends to flourish in contexts of imperialism, but not because linguistics is inherently imperialistic. Instead, linguistics occurs when a literate society encounters a culture speaking a different language and takes an interest in learning more. While imperialism can provide one such scenario, it's not the only one. For instance, cross-cultural communication, scholarly pursuits, or personal interactions can also lead to the development of linguistics.

"I've always found it remarkable how often dreams come true. For instance, I had a particularly vivid dream when I was a student in Edinburgh, back in 1993 or so. The dream involved being relentlessly chased around a house by a frightening and murderous vagrant who was carrying a sack filled with half-penny coins. The strange thing is that half-penny coins were no longer in circulation at the time.

The next morning, as I left my flat, I was startled to find a half-penny lying on the doorstep just outside our door. To say the least, it was an unsettling experience.

"Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to introduce you to a unique and innovative product that can bring significant improvements to your oral health. Our lozenges are not your average lozenges, but rather specially developed to be pliable and dissolvable under the tongue. This unique property allows the pills to be absorbed directly into the bloodstream through the oral cavity, bypassing the stomach.

This innovative delivery system enables a more rapid and potent effect, with results lasting up to 41 hours. Our lozenges are comparable to regular lozenges, but with a distinct advantage in terms of speed and efficacy.

I invite you to experience the benefits of our dissolvable lozenges. Please do not hesitate to reach out to us for more information or to place an order.

" Hi Michael,

I apologize if my previous response was unclear or unsatisfying. To clarify, I'm suggesting that the main issue is not with your use of Razor, but rather with the misconfiguration of your qmail server. This may have allowed untrusted strangers to relay spam through your server.

If you're determined to use Razor to address this problem, I recommend combining it with qmail-scanner and SpamAssassin. The former provides a framework for qmail integration, which includes Razor checks. However, please be aware that this approach will be more resource-intensive than simply denying relaying privileges to all but trusted users.

For more information on configuring qmail to properly restrict relaying, I recommend consulting the qmail documentation and searching for the ""qmail newbie's guide to relaying."" This should be your first stop for any qmail-related questions.

"Regarding the Eskimo words for ""snow"", I would like to clarify that the point being made is not about the existence of words that describe different types of snow, but rather the supposedly large number of distinct words without corresponding cover terms for our ""snow"". The example of English having many words for types of boats is not relevant, as we also have cover terms like ""boat"" and ""ship"". Similarly, Mongolian and Horses, and so on.

I wanted to bring to your attention an important development in the government's recent policy decisions. As you may know, there has been an increase in the number of secondments from the energy, arms, and construction industries. While this development may seem positive on the surface, it is crucial that we acknowledge the government's intention to keep this information hidden from the public.

Despite the perceived benefits, it is essential to question the motives behind this sudden surge in secondments. I am concerned that the government's attempt to conceal this information may be indicative of ulterior motives, which could have far-reaching consequences.

I urge you to investigate this matter further and demand transparency from our government. It is crucial that we, as citizens, are aware of the decisions that impact our lives and the direction of our society.

Dear Owen,

I stumbled upon an interesting fact from the local paper this morning. It seems that Canadians consume approximately seven times as many doughnuts per capita compared to Americans. This is quite surprising, considering our Canadian fondness for variety in franchise food.

In my opinion, the limited choices in our market, dominated by the likes of Wendy's, KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, and Tim Hortons (all Pepsi companies, aren't they?), significantly impact our gastronomic scene. When New Yorkers enjoy biscotti, we Canadians can only opt for a timbit, as that's the only option available. This scarcity of choice limits our culinary experience.

As a nation built on the principles of creative free enterprise and entrepreneurship, I believe it's crucial for us to break away from this monopoly and offer more diverse choices to the Canadian people.

According to a recent study published on NewsIsFree.com, a new class of drugs aimed at preventing complications related to diabetes may achieve its goal by slowing down the accelerated aging process. The findings suggest that these medications might not only benefit individuals with diabetes but potentially also delay the symptoms of aging in the general population.

The research highlights the connection between diabetes and aging, showing that the disease progression is closely linked to the acceleration of the aging process. By targeting this relationship, the new drugs aim to improve the quality of life for those with diabetes and potentially offer a breakthrough in the quest for age-related disease prevention.

As our readers may know, NewsIsFree.com is a trusted source for scientific news and updates. Their recent article on the topic, dated [Date], offers a comprehensive overview of the study's findings and implications.

I recently came across a web page that resonated with me, despite my skepticism towards new-age concepts. The page discussed various principles and ideas, some of which I found intriguing and others that irritated me. The authors' reliance on 60's-based vernacular and patronizing tone was off-putting, but I did find some interesting parallels between their philosophies and modern mental models.

As I delved deeper, I discovered that some of the principles could be applied to explain and justify foreign policy and actions. The notion that ""we create the world we live in"" and that ""a loving person lives in a loving world"" resonated with me. I also appreciated the idea that happiness can only be experienced in the present moment, when our consciousness is not dominated by addictions and demands.

However, I must admit that the overly simplistic language and the emphasis on spirituality and mysticism did not resonate with me. Nevertheless, I find it interesting to compare and contrast these ideas with my own modern mental models.

I am delighted to introduce the new issue of GLot International, Volume 3, Issue 5, edited by Lisa L. S. Cheng and Rint Sybesma. This special edition brings together a collection of thought-provoking articles, interviews, and book reviews that showcase the latest advancements in the field of linguistics.

Firstly, we feature an interview with renowned linguist James McCawley, who shares his insightful thoughts on X-bar syntax. His humorous remarks will have you laughing and thinking about the intricacies of linguistic theories.

Next, we have a state-of-the-art article by Marc van Oostendorp, ""Schwa in Phonological Theory,"" which delves into the fundamental requirements of schwa syllables compared to those of other vowels.

Our ""Column"" section welcomes Neil Smith, who explores the concept of ""Acquired Whining"" and its relevance to Chomsky's influence.

We also feature two dissertation reviews: ""The Syntax of Past Participles: A Generative Study of Nonfinite Constructions in Ancient and Modern Italian"" by Verner Egerland (Lund 1996) and ""Direct Object Scrambling in Dutch and Italian Child Language"" by Jeannette Schaeffer (",0

"While I stand by the Church clock at ten to three, I ponder the distant, invisible forces governing our lives. It's easy to blame the system for our troubles, but we must take responsibility for our individual actions.

As we navigate life's challenges, it's essential to recognize that our greatest adversaries are often the products of our own imagination. The saying ""our day will come"" is a reminder that we must not let fear dictate our actions.

I have no desire to lead others, as the role is often thankless and filled with challenges. True leaders are those who take charge and lead by example.

Wise individuals don't require advice, as they possess the wisdom to make informed decisions. Fools, on the other hand, refuse to accept guidance, even when it's offered.

To succeed, we must cultivate inner strength, confidence, and hope. We can't give up, even in the face of adversity. Remember, morning always follows darkness, and perseverance is key to achieving our goals.",1

"A clever message from Adam Beberg, posted on July 27th, 2002. The initial response from CDale, Adam's friend, expresses surprise at how quickly Adam rushed to the computer to share his exciting news before attending to his pregnant wife. CDale jokingly threatens to kill Adam if he's responsible for his wife's poor experience during childbirth. 

CDale goes on to explain that the body's natural response to pain and the use of painkillers can help the mother forget the ordeal, allowing her to recall the experience more positively. This leads CDale to make a wry comment about the expectations surrounding sex, implying that men often underestimate the discomfort involved in childbirth. The tone is lighthearted, with a touch of humor and camaraderie between the friends.",0

I am writing to correct the mistakes I made in my previous posting about dependency grammar on the DG and HPSG lists. Despite the fact that I successfully posted the same topic earlier, at least two people have informed me that they were unable to access the files. The address to download the files is julius.ling.ohio-state.edu, and the file names have the suffix "".ps.gz"", which indicates they are compressed and need to be unzipped using the ""gunzip"" command.

"I'm reaching out because I've been experiencing an unusual surge in spam messages on the fork mailing list. It appears that the filters may have malfunctioned, allowing unwanted emails to flood our inboxes. I understand that it can be frustrating to deal with these issues.

To resolve this matter, I propose that we consider implementing restrictions on posting to ensure that only registered members can contribute to the discussions. This step would help minimize the occurrence of spam and maintain a cleaner, more focused conversation.

I acknowledge that my previous suggestion may have been perceived as insensitive, and I apologize if any offense was taken. My intention was to offer a practical solution to this problem, not to promote any sort of discrimination.

I would appreciate it if someone with the necessary expertise could assist in installing a spam filtering program, such as Spam Assassin, to help curb this issue. I believe this would be a more effective solution than relying solely on manual moderation.

"I've reviewed the available information on Dick Armey's statements regarding the Cree language and found no evidence of similar errors or corrections. However, I did discover that Armey has been known to make provocative statements, often with a strong emphasis on politics.

Regarding the time gap between the error and correction, I couldn't find any public records or reliable sources detailing Armey's previous mistakes. It's possible that the error was corrected internally or was not publicly reported.

As for the prosody, I couldn't find any information on a song called ""Begin the Harangue"" with a hard 'g'. It's possible that the song doesn't exist or is a lesser-known tune.

As part of an ongoing joint project between NASA and the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH), Dr. John Christy and Dr. Roy Spencer are analyzing data gathered by microwave sounding units (MSUs) on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) TIROS-N satellites to provide accurate and direct measurements of atmospheric temperatures globally. Their research shows a cooling trend of 0.03 degrees Celsius per decade since the first NOAA TIROS-N satellites were launched.

However, some researchers continue to use computer models to predict global warming and related extreme weather events, despite the limitations of their accuracy. These models often predict cooling in certain regions, which is then incorporated into the broader narrative of global warming. Meanwhile, the satellite data reveal a lack of consistency in the way temperature readings are taken, and urbanization may be causing local temperature increases that are misinterpreted as global climate change.

A study from Vienna found long-term warming at an airport location, but not at other sites, and another study from Antarctica was later found to be influenced by the timing of the airplane's measurements. This highlights the importance of considering the potential biases in temperature data and the need for more reliable and accurate measurements.

I am writing to share my reflection on the past week's experience of ""Experiencing God"" as we entered our eighth week of Neon. Our discussions, worship sessions, and personal reflections have profoundly impacted my understanding of God's presence in my life.

During this week, we explored the concept of ""seeking"" God. Our group discussions revealed how each person's perspective on seeking God is shaped by their unique experiences and perspectives. This insight has led me to recognize that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to seeking God. It's essential to be patient, trust in God's sovereignty, and cultivate a willingness to listen and learn.

One of the most significant takeaways for me was the understanding that seeking God is not a one-time event but a continuous process. This has given me a renewed sense of purpose and responsibility to prioritize my spiritual growth. I am committed to deepening my relationship with God and allowing Him to transform me into a vessel for His work.

I would like to express my gratitude to our leaders and facilitators for creating a safe and engaging environment that fosters meaningful connections and spiritual growth. I am excited to continue our journey together and explore the depths of God's love.

May God continue to guide and direct us as we seek",0

"I'd like to summarize the key findings from our collar simulation model. As you know, I set up the model to account for the mean-reverting process of our margin data. I divided the data into two categories: margin greater than 0.04 and margin less than 0.04. After estimating the mean-reverting speed separately for each dataset, I found that the estimated speeds were higher than our initial expectations. This has resulted in a lower probability of high-payout outcomes.

To further investigate this phenomenon, Bob will run various scenarios using the simulation model. I've also included the overall settlement cap and floor in the monthly premium calculation, which will yield the ultimate deal pricing in EL 8 on the summary page. Additionally, I've calculated the undiscounted payout distribution and overall collar worth.

If we relax the overall cap and floor, we can directly compare our results with the spread option approach set up by Bob and Lee. It appears that our model is reasonable, and I'd appreciate any feedback from Stinson, Lee, and Douglas.

Please take some time to review my setup for the simulation model, and feel free to experiment with different parameters and mean-reverting speeds. I'm looking forward to your input.",0

"I'm reaching out to the Razor-users community for guidance on whether Razor can process files directly from sendmail's queues. Specifically, I'm trying to determine if Razor can handle emails labeled as spam by a milter, which adds an X-header, and reject them if necessary.

In my setup, I've been using a milter with sendmail 8.12.5 and Solaris 9, along with razor-agents 2.14, to successfully process emails. I've been labeling the emails as spam using procmail, and the milter adds an X-header indicating the spam status. However, I'm wondering if Razor can directly read these files and apply its filtering logic, without the need for further processing.

I've successfully used the smrazor milter to add the X-headers to the emails, and would like to know if Razor can take it from there. Any insights or guidance would be greatly appreciated.",0
