As you consider the algorithms used to calculate confidence values, I believe it's crucial to recognize that revoking spam that everyone else considers as spam will likely incur a significant penalty. This may seem counterintuitive, as revoking spam would seem to indicate a more accurate assessment. However, the system may view this as an indication of a misaligned perspective, leading to a decrease in trust.

The issue arises when there are ""gray"" mails, where some people vote ""spam"" while others vote ""nonspam."" Under the proposed system, anyone who consistently votes ""gray"" mail as nonspam will likely accumulate a poor trust score. This could lead to an unfortunate scenario where even their own submissions are no longer considered in flagging their own spam. The confusion and frustration this might cause could be significant, with users asking, ""But I just marked that exact message as spam. Why is it not being considered spam? I'm an honest submitter.""

The degree to which trust is affected seems to depend on the proportion of reports versus revokes. If everyone except one person classifies a mail as spam, the lone dissenter will see a significant decrease in trust. Conversely, if you're part of the majority, your trust will increase.

This classic work has had a significant impact on recent developments in syntactic theory, exploring a wide range of topics such as phrase structure, quantifier scope, anaphora, movement constraints, and interrogative sentences. By analyzing a vast array of grammatical constructions in Chinese (and English), Huang sheds new light on the theory of universal grammar and linguistic typology, often revealing insights not readily apparent in the study of European languages.

Some of the notable findings include: a parametric theory of quantifier scope, a relativized notion of a ""governing category"" for Chomsky's Binding Theory, a theory of generalized control leading to the pro-drop parameter and related phenomena, a proposed condition on extraction domains (CED) for overt movement, and a proposal for LF wh-movement in languages without wh-movement.

I'm writing to share some unfortunate news with you. Edwina Currie, a former government minister, has expressed her sadness and indignation after learning that John Major, a former British Prime Minister, had an affair with her that lasted for four years. This development has sparked controversy, with many people condemning the infidelity.

It's crucial to note that Edwina Currie has been vocal about her disappointment and shame in having been involved in such a long and illicit relationship. The news has raised questions about the morality and ethics of John Major's actions, particularly given his public persona as a respected leader.

The incident has drawn widespread attention and sparked debate about the consequences of such behavior, not just for the individuals involved but also for the reputation of those in positions of power.

Please let me know if you'd like more information or if there's anything else I can help you with.

This does not seem an unrealistic assumption, considering the ease with which multiple sexual partners can be obtained in such environments.

The story about wolves attacking their sheep is a great illustration of their principles. According to this story, when wolves attack, the Tibetans corral the wolf into a trap and then throw rocks from the surrounding cliffs to make it seem like the wolf was killed by someone other than themselves. This practice is reflective of their emphasis on minimizing harm and avoiding taking a life, even in self-defense.

It's also worth noting that in Samskar, the region had experienced a remarkable period of peace, with no recorded killings in over 2,000 years. Even disputes over resources, like a water hole, were resolved without resorting to violence. It's impressive to see how their philosophical approach to life has led to a culture of non-aggression.

Would love to hear your thoughts on this, Justin! Do you have any personal experiences or insights on Tibetan Buddhism that you'd like to share?"

Dear Sir/Madan,

I am writing to introduce myself and seek your assistance in a matter of utmost importance. My name is Wilson Kamela, a senior employee of the Mines and Natural Resources Department, currently on a training course in Holland. I am pleased to inform you that I have a vested interest in a redeemable investment valued at $15.5 million, previously purchased by Lucio Harper in 1977.

Since the investment has matured, we have made several attempts to contact Lucio Harper, but to no avail. We are unable to reach his close relatives, who were the intended beneficiaries of the investment. Fortunately, we have access to all relevant information, and we can claim this money with the help of my partners in the South African Mines and Natural Resources Department.

To facilitate the claim, we require someone to file a claim on behalf of Lucio Harper, and in this regard, we are willing to offer you a substantial percentage of the investment. You will receive 25% of the total amount, and once the claim is approved, this money can be paid directly into any bank account of your choice.

In return, we ask that you ensure our share of 70% is secured. A small portion of 5% will be set"

To meet this demand, we must carefully choose the place and time to provide these services. Once we've selected the ideal location and schedule, the rest will fall into place.

It's often said that when common sense is lacking, everything else is too. In the world of pharmaceutical services, this adage rings particularly true. The only way to truly succeed in this field is to develop and maintain personal qualities that set us apart. As the Russian composer Tchaikovsky once wrote, ""nothing endures but personal qualities."" It's the qualities that make each of us unique that will ultimately ensure our success in the ever-changing landscape of pharmaceutical services.

By focusing on developing these qualities, we can position ourselves for success and build a reputation as a trusted provider of pharmaceutical services.

As you can see, the drift numbers have decreased significantly from 2000 due to decreased interest rates.

I am pleased to inform you that your requested medications have been dispatched, and you can expect them to arrive shortly. In particular, we have successfully processed your order for Levitra, a medication that belongs to the same oral impotence medication family as Viagra.

I'd like to emphasize the importance of being prudent and wise when dealing with financial matters, as you said. It is indeed a wise decision to appear foolish only when it's necessary, as you are, and to approach life's challenges with caution.

On a separate note, I understand that you don't believe in the existence of God, but I'm intrigued by your interest in the concept. It's a complex and multifaceted topic that has puzzled philosophers and scholars for centuries. If you ever wish to discuss it further, I'm more than happy to engage in a respectful and thought-provoking conversation.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any further questions or concerns. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Best regards,

I don&#x27;t think there is a specific word in English for eye goop.  However, when I was halfway literate in Tagalog, I learned that there is a specific word in that language (or was it another dialect?) for it: muta, pronounced &quot;MOO-ta&quot;.  Even though my Tagalog has faded greatly, I automatically use that word for &quot;eye goop&quot; when speaking English (how often does that happen?), mostly because it apparently filled a linguistic hole in my brain and therefore permanently wedged itself into my vocabulary.Not that this is important, but I&#x27;ve inadvertently adopted &quot;muta&quot; into my version of the English language as the word for &quot;eye goop&quot;.

I'm writing to share a peculiar phenomenon that's stuck with me since childhood. When I was five, my dad would point out ""smegma"" in my eye and gently remove it. As a result, I developed an unusual habit of referring to eye discharge as ""muta"" (pronounced ""MOO-ta""), which I learned in Tagalog. Although my language skills have deteriorated since then, ""muta"" has become an integral part of my vocabulary for describing ""eye goop"".

I must admit that I find ""muta"" more appealing than ""smegma"", and it's become a linguistic quirk of mine. I'm not sure how often I've inadvertently used ""muta"" in English, but it's definitely become a permanent fixture in my speech."

( 2 ) at this time , the consensus is not to relase the historical implementation into production , and the official line to traders will be that the method is still in testing . the historical var is 19 . 2 mm and the implied is 37 mm for effective date of 09 / 25 . ( 3 ) further testing is in progress on a hybrid methodology ( which i mentioned last week , whereby historical vols are scaled by the ratio of prompt to historical - prompt volatilities ) , to atleast capture some implied / forward effects . tanya &#x27; s analysis on a fictitious portfolio indicates higher var numbers , but poorer backtesting in comparison to the historical approach . this approach serves as an intermediate , and seems appropriate in periods such as the current one , wherein the historical numbers might be considerably lower than those of the implied . ( 4 ) winston will start testing using these hybrid vols , and if the results are deemed satisfactory , that will be the production methodology . of course , we will obtain all var numbers concurrently to serve as different indicators and beacons of risk . the production number will hopefully be a sensible compromise of the different methods . regards naveen",0,"
Regarding the implementation for FFVols, I would like to provide an update on the progress we've made. After analyzing historical and implied volatility calculations for Agg-Gas over a six-day period, we have observed a notable difference. Specifically, the historical volatility calculations have consistently been lower by approximately 17 mm, while the implied volatilities were significantly higher, anticipating stronger winter prices.

As a result, we have decided not to release the historical implementation into production at this time. Instead, we will maintain the official line with traders that the method is still under testing. The current historical variance is 19.2 mm, and the implied variance is 37 mm, effective from 09/25.

To address this discrepancy, we are continuing to test a hybrid methodology. This approach involves scaling historical vols by the ratio of prompt to historical-prompt volatilities. Tanya's analysis of a fictitious portfolio suggests that this hybrid approach generates higher variance numbers, but poorer backtesting compared to the historical approach.

Winston will begin testing using this hybrid vol method, and if the results are satisfactory, it will become the production methodology. We will ensure that all variance numbers are concurrently calculated to serve as indicators and risk beacons. Our goal is to"

But we&#x27;re  usually pretty greasy enough to bite our leg off, squirm free and run  off.&quot;",0,"We believe that the key to the Mekons' continued excitement is their loose, eclectic approach to music. According to Langford, this flexibility keeps the band's sound fresh and engaging. When the Mekons were solely focused on their music as a full-time profession, they began to feel stifled and uninspired. They found themselves getting stuck in a rut, but they were able to break free from the constraints by taking risks and embracing their creative freedom.

In essence, the Mekons are able to maintain their momentum by being willing to try new things and not getting too comfortable with their existing sound. This willingness to experiment allows them to stay excited about their music and continue producing innovative and entertaining work."

I wanted to follow up on our previous discussion regarding the offer from Enron. As we previously agreed, I understand that it may be challenging for Enron to accommodate my desired starting date. I'd like to reiterate that I'm flexible and willing to work around Enron's needs.

To address the bonus situation, I'd like to propose two alternatives. Firstly, if Enron is willing to have me start immediately, I'd expect them to compensate for my missed bonus from Williams this year. However, considering we're already in October, I acknowledge this may not be a fair arrangement.

Alternatively, we could work out an offer now, and I'd start my new job after I receive my bonus from Williams, which should be in early February. This option suits me well, as Williams has had a good year, and I wouldn't mind delaying my start date.

Please note that I'm extremely interested in joining your group at Enron and am excited about this opportunity. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to me at 918-409-4308.

Regarding our campus recruiting strategy for next fall, I would like to inquire about the internship recruiting practices of companies that are our primary competition in this area, specifically the Big 5 accounting firms. It appears that these firms interview in May for a spring internship in the 4th year of their Professional Program in Accounting (PPA). We need to target 4th year PPAs in the fall before their spring internship or 3rd year PPAs in the spring. I would like to discuss and plan our approach for this between now and next fall. I am committed to interviewing for interns in both the spring and fall.

Dear colleagues,

I'd like to share a concerning development in one of our sci-fi authors' upcoming stories. They plan to incorporate a statement that could be perceived as insensitive, namely: ""The worst strategic mistake since the 911 attacks."" While the intention might not be malicious, we must consider the potential impact on our audience.

In a recent article, Hanson wrote about the significance of September 11th in an online publication. You can find the article at [link]. It's essential that we're mindful of the delicate topic and avoid any potential triggers.

Please be aware of this planned inclusion in the story and discuss any concerns with the author.

I would like to propose extending the time period for referencing disputed items on the working capital statement, considering that we might not be able to resolve everything by December 4th due to the upcoming holidays.

(see sigaltstack() ) possibly glibc does not brk() back the space, just like malloc()/free() does not always release the space to the heap again (as most programmes will allocate memory / threads again soonish anyway).&gt; Regards, &gt;  &gt; Vinregards, --  Paul Jakma paul@clubi.ie paul@jakma.org Key ID: 64A2FF6A  warning: do not ever send email to spam@dishone.st Fortune: The Official Colorado State Vegetable is now the &quot;state legislator&quot;.--  Irish Linux Users&#x27; Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information. List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie",0,"
When a client connects to the system, it initially appears as a single main process with one child process, corresponding to the heartbeat2 program. As the client sleeps for 5 seconds, a new child process (the client program) is spawned, along with another heartbeat2 process. At this point, the process list shows three processes.

However, when the client exits, the second child process (heartbeat2) fails to terminate, and instead remains active. This results in a rise in memory consumption, with approximately 8-9MB of memory allocated for each new client connection.

The issue is unclear, and it is not immediately apparent whether it is a C++ bug, a Linux bug, or a coding error. One possibility is that the thread manager created by the pthreads library is responsible for the extra process. This is normal behavior, as the thread manager is created only after the accept() function returns, and remains active to manage subsequent threads.

Additionally, it is possible that the stack for the extra threads is allocated from the heap, which may not be released back to the system. This could be due to the way glibc handles memory allocation and deallocation, which may not always release space to the heap.

It is unclear whether further investigation is necessary"

Since everyone is working on multiple tasks due to our limited manpower, we understand if you need to renegotiate the delivery date with the customer. Keep in mind that EES has completed deals that required Asian option valuation in the credit model, so it's essential to ensure timely completion.

As we continue to explore the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis in introductory linguistics, I am faced with updating my understanding of its current status. After extensive research and conversations with linguists, I would like to share my findings and seek your input on how to present this material fairly and accurately.

In recent years, I have been following the debate surrounding Whorf's mild version of linguistic relativity. While no one has disproved this theory, Pinker's book ""The Language Instinct"" presents a conflicting view, suggesting that Whorf was incorrect on all counts. This has led me to question what conclusion is now appropriate to draw in the context of linguistics.

Given the vast literature on the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis, I would like to summarize the current state of knowledge and invite feedback from those who have taught or researched this topic. I am interested in hearing your experiences and incorporating your insights into my presentation.

Please feel free to respond to me at akaye@fullerton.edu or directly to this network, whichever is more convenient for you. Your input will be greatly appreciated, and I look forward to your responses.

I wanted to touch base and provide an update on the key HR issues we're working on. Firstly, we've established a ""work-out"" group under Cindy Skinner's leadership, which will be responsible for generating statistics and ensuring we stay on track. We've already seen significant progress, with several employees having gone through the process. The statistics will clearly show this and provide insight into the progress of others.

Additionally, we've gained total clarity on our direction, and all necessary memos will be distributed by Monday. Cindy Olson has also sent an email to the HR community regarding the embargo on HPL staff, and Mark H is drafting a corresponding memo for OTC staff.

Fran, Michele Cash, and another team member have all been assigned to work on this project. I believe we're making great strides, and I'm confident that we'll be able to resolve these key HR issues moving forward.

"I attended the same conference, and was impressed by a few systems that Jim didn&#x27;t mention. In terms of CMS, the following all had apparently been used in some fairly large implementations and looked like some pretty strong competition to commercial systems: - Midgard, http://www.midgard-project.org/ , a PHP-based content management framework that with other programs combines to be a full CMS - Redhat CCM CMS, Java-based: http://www.spamassassin.taint.org/software/ccm/cms/ - OpenCMS, Java-based: http://www.opencms.orgThere was agreement that usability has not generally been an open source strength, but both Plone and Xopus represented some real movement towards improving that situation.I was impressed by the spectrum of perspectives on XML. Some took for granted that XSLT was relevant to content management, others took it just as for granted that XSLT was irrelevant and seemed happy to ignore XML almost completely. I attended realizing that &quot;content management&quot; is generally used to apply to *Web* content management, but I was still a bit shocked how completely out of scope document management was (almost no consideration of the potential print/PDF dimension to content other than the occasional &quot;...and you can use FOP to make PDF&quot; as if that was functional): this seems more the case in open source content management than in commercial content management, and probably makes XML easier to ignore (if HTML is the be-all and end-all of the output...).The honesty was refreshing, Phil Suh complained about the state of current tools (both open source and commercial), and I wish I&#x27;d written down what he said, something like &quot;it sucks so extremely, it sucks so widely, and it is so generally sucking, that it seems sometimes there is no hope.&quot; For a moment there was contemplation that perhaps commercial systems scaled so well that the commercial &quot;big boys&quot; were really much more functional than open source, until someone pointed out, &quot;OK, take some average blog software, spend $500,000 on the rollout... it&#x27;ll scale pretty well.&quot; Another quote (citing Brendan Quinn): &quot;content management problems are either trivial or impossible.&quot;Mac OS X is getting popular, of the laptops there it was an even 1/3 each of Mac, Linux, Windows.I am sure it wasn&#x27;t news to Jim, but I can&#x27;t wait to try Subversion, a CVS replacement that supports some of the newer features of WebDAV: http://subversion.tigris.org/I&#x27;m also eager to try Xopus, I hope the developers make it back home safely, they said they&#x27;d only been in America four days but were already homeless...Max",0,"Thank you for sharing your impressions of the conference with me. I was particularly interested in your observations about the open source content management systems you encountered. It seems that there are several systems, such as Midgard, Redhat CCM CMS, and OpenCMS, that have been used in large implementations and may be worth exploring as alternatives to commercial systems. I was also struck by the emphasis on improving usability, particularly in systems like Plone and Xopus. It's clear that the concept of ""content management"" is often narrowly defined as web content management, with little attention paid to document management and the print/PDF dimension. I appreciated your candid remarks about the current state of tools, both open source and commercial, and your comment about the potential for commercial systems to scale well with large investments. It's also worth noting that the conference seemed to feature a mix of laptop platforms, with Mac OS X being an increasingly popular choice. I'm intrigued by your mention of Subversion, a CVS replacement that supports newer WebDAV features, and Xopus, which I hope will receive further development."

Dear Colleagues,

We invite proposals for papers to be presented at the 6th Symposium for Language Teacher Educators, to be held at the University of Edinburgh's Institute for Applied Language Studies from November 18th to 20th, 1998. The symposium aims to bring together language teacher educators from the UK and overseas to share research and best practices in language teacher education.

The themes we have identified include the role of research and evaluation in language teacher education, methods of researching and evaluating language teacher education, and the ethics of evaluation and research in this field. We also welcome submissions on evaluating programs, trainers, and materials in language teacher education, researching the influence of context on the delivery of language teacher education, and more.

Papers can take the form of research reports, reflections on the process of research and evaluation, or discussions on the role of research and evaluation in language teacher education. We encourage proposals from anyone interested in submitting a paper on a topic related to these themes.

To submit a proposal, please write to us at the address below or email ials.symposium@ed.ac.uk. We are limited to 60 participants, so please submit your proposal as soon as possible.

Please note that the deadline for proposals is [insert deadline"

Unfortunately, I don't have a bootable Windows floppy disk, and formatting the entire disk didn't restore the NT MBR. 

To address this issue, I've been advised to execute ""fdisk /mbr"" from a bootable Windows floppy disk. Alternatively, I can boot from a Linux boot disk and delete all partitions using fdisk. However, I'm concerned that if I delete the MBR, it will destroy the OS on that drive. I'm seeking alternative methods to remove LILO without performing the fdisk procedure. 

If someone has experience with a similar situation, I'd appreciate any guidance on how to restore the original NT MBR without formatting the entire disk.

"&gt; From: Stephen D. Williams [mailto:swilliams@hpti.com]&gt;  &gt; Just to further weaken the food transaction argument, I&#x27;ll note that in &gt; my neighborhood, the local McDonalds won&#x27;t even hand you your drink in &gt; the drive through until you fork over the cash.   Maybe you never bought a hot dog from a street vendor.&gt; And why is it that the margin of survival is so thin?  Could it be that &gt; all of these tribal rivalries are part of what&#x27;s holding back wholesale &gt; movement to the modern, first world patterns of constructive thinking?Well, yes.  But it doesn&#x27;t change the idea that the margin of survival probably IS that thin in this region.&gt; I&#x27;m sure that both sides were ready to be the agressor.  I&#x27;m not.  I&#x27;m sure both sides were equally ready to be the aggressor provided they were in a predominant position of power.&gt; Bush&#x27;s reluctance to blast blind obeyance of religion as taught by your &gt; local madrassa or KKK leader, apparently because he is fully involved &gt; with the general effort to expand unfettered religiosity as the solution &gt; to the world&#x27;s ills, is disappointing.  He has spoke against madrassa, &gt; but what I heard sounded lame and carefully crafted to shield religion &gt; in general from scrutiny.1. Which religion and how it is currently being expressed matters. 2. The US is trying to avoid making war on the Muslim religion. 3. US Leadership remains reflexively multi-cultural.&gt; We all have &gt; disagreements, but at some point it becomes a crime against humanity.I didn&#x27;t say burning the train was a good thing.  I said I understood it wasn&#x27;t a spontaneous attack on people who had done no wrong. ",0,"I'd like to clarify a few points related to the argument against the food transaction model. In my neighborhood, the local McDonald's doesn't hand over drinks in the drive-through until cash is paid upfront, which may provide insight into the margin of survival in our region. I've never purchased a hot dog from a street vendor, and the thin margin may contribute to the slow adoption of modern, first-world patterns of constructive thinking.

I acknowledge that both sides were likely willing to be the aggressor, and I believe neither side should take that path. I'm disappointed that President Bush didn't forcefully condemn blind obedience to religion, particularly in the context of madrassa teachings or KKK ideology. His statement seemed carefully crafted to avoid scrutinizing religion in general.

It's essential to recognize that not all religions or expressions of faith are equal, and the US is trying to avoid making war on the Muslim faith. However, the US government remains committed to being multicultural.

I want to emphasize that our disagreements are natural, but at some point, they become a crime against humanity. I didn't condone the destruction of the train, but I understood it wasn't a spontaneous attack against innocent people."

Regarding the HSR waiting period issue, I'd like to assure you that we can move forward with our plans. However, to ensure a smooth transition, please note that all correspondence will be handled through the UBS Call Center in Connecticut, starting tomorrow morning.

To ensure seamless communication, the following changes will be implemented:

* The fax number will be based in Connecticut, with calls rolling over to Houston.
* The Call Center person in Connecticut will answer help desk calls, which will then be transferred to Houston.
* The Call Center in Connecticut will send PA faxes according to instructions from Houston.
* The cover letter will feature UBS letterhead but remain unsigned, with Connecticut numbers specified.
* The splash page will be modified to display Connecticut numbers.
* Once we reach the closing date, the numbers will be permanently forwarded to Houston.
* All future correspondence, including bulk mailings, will specify the Houston number.

I'm attaching a technical risk template to serve as an outline for our upcoming meeting. In preparing for the meeting, please focus on the key items of scope definition, construction execution, and contractor analysis that can impact value. We aim to identify what we need to pay attention to as we begin to ramp up capital expenditures. With the recent attention on the Dabhol and Cuiba projects, managing construction risk has become a vital topic.

Additionally, we should take time to discuss and settle the outstanding EE&CC invoice (now EEOS). I'd like to agree on a payment number and move forward with EEOS.

The system going forward will ensure no EEOS costs are incurred or transferred to the EA Origination Group until we've pre-approved them. Let's take a closer look at the major commercial terms and conditions driving schedule, performance, and cost.

Unfortunately, &gt; you hit a bunch of problems: &gt; &gt; * When can you &quot;commit&quot; a state as being &quot;good&quot;? You can&#x27;t &gt; run from a redo log forever; the performance and storage &gt; penalties accumulate. Even log structured file systems &gt; garbage collect eventually. So you have to commit sometime. &gt; The problem is that if you commit too eagerly, you might &gt; commit corrupted state. If you commit too conservatively, &gt; you eat performance and storage penalties. &gt; * What do you do if you discover that there is corrupted state &gt; in the *middle* of your redo log, and you want some of the &gt; critical state that comes after it? You need some way to dig &gt; the corruption out of the middle and save the rest. My &gt; dissertation solves this problem, but you have to re-write &gt; everything in my programming language :) &gt; * Just doing this at all imposes substantial performance &gt; penalties. I love VMWare, and use it every day (the best &gt; $200 I ever spent on software) but it is not very fast. &gt; &gt; My proposed solution to the first two problems you mention is to be &gt; less ambitious. The idea is that you *never* commit - instead, you &gt; simply revert to base state on reboot.Ah. In that case, you can use something considerably less powerful than VMWare. All you need is a machine configured to boot from CD-ROM and use a RAM disk for scratch space. Numerous Linux distros are available that let you boot a stateless but functional system from CD-ROM.&gt; Obviously, you can&#x27;t do this with partitions that accrue important &gt; state, e.g. a partition that stores database table data.... but if you *do* want some state to persist, then you need a mountable writable partition. To protect it, you need some kind of access control management to decide who can do what to the writable partition, blah blah blah ... and before you know it, the security problem starts to look just like it does for conventional servers.Simple approxmation to this: make /usr a separate partion, and mount it read-only: * The good news: attackers that want to trojan your software have to reboot, at least. * The bad news: administrators that want to update your software have to reboot, at least.Crispin-- Crispin Cowan, Ph.D. Chief Scientist, WireX http://wirex.com/~crispin/ Security Hardened Linux Distribution: http://immunix.org Available for purchase: http://wirex.com/Products/Immunix/purchase.html",0," 
As you're considering the use of base and delta images for automated recovery from attacks, I'd like to share my thoughts. I was inspired by a mode of operation supported by VMWare, where you can roll back state to recover from intrusions. I also explored this concept in my dissertation work on Optimistic Computing, which aimed to apply this idea to security problems.

However, I quickly discovered that it's not a straightforward approach. You need to consider when you can commit a state as being ""good"" without compromising performance and storage. This is because you can't run indefinitely from a redo log, and the penalties accumulate. You have to commit at some point, but if you commit too eagerly, you might commit corrupted state, and if you commit too conservatively, you'll eat into performance and storage.

Additionally, you need to address the issue of corrupted state in the middle of your redo log. You require a way to dig out the corruption and save the critical state that comes after it.

In response to these challenges, I proposed a less ambitious solution. Instead of committing state, you can simply revert to a base state on reboot. This approach is less resource-intensive and doesn't require the power of VMWare.

I wanted to summarize our conversation regarding Howard Haughton's experience with Enron. From what I gathered, Howard is interested in having a second-round interview with senior management representatives. He felt that the previous interviewers didn't fully understand his technical abilities and language. Although, he believes that the initial interview went well.

The only concern is that Howard is currently on a 10-day vacation and won't be available for another interview until then.

Thanks,

This special issue of Linguistics Volume 36, Number 4 presents a collection of articles that explore the development of the verb category from a cross-linguistic perspective. The issue is edited by Elena V.M. Lieven, and it features contributions from renowned scholars in the field.

The introduction, written by Shanley Allen, sets the stage for the subsequent articles, which examine the verb category in different languages. Heike Behrens' article investigates the learning of causative verbs in Inuktitut, while Penelope Brown's study looks at the difficulty of complex verbs in German, Dutch, and English.

Soonja Choi's contribution focuses on the emergence of the verb category in early lexical and syntactic development in Korean, and Katherine Demuth's article explores the relationship between argument structure and the acquisition of Sesotho applicatives. Michael Maratsos' article compares different models of the development of the English verb category.

The special issue concludes with a commentary section, which provides a comprehensive overview of the topics discussed in the preceding articles.

We hope that this special issue will contribute to a deeper understanding of the verb category and its development across languages.

I&#x27;m skeptical.  One of the many perversions of modern civilization is the fictitious rendering of various peoples, frequently to the point where the fiction is more &quot;real&quot; than the reality.  You see it over and over again in history:  The Primitive People pull a fast one on Whitey The Junior Anthropologist, playing to all the prejudices of Whitey (who only became Junior Anthropologists to support personal ideologies), and before you know it the charade takes on a life of its own which the Primitive People are compelled to perpetuate.  Worse, even when there is substantial evidence to the contrary with some basic scholarship, the facts have a hard time competing with the ideologically pleasing fiction that is already firmly entrenched.  And many peoples (e.g. American Indians) develop a profit motive for maintaining and promoting the myth in popular culture.I&#x27;m far more inclined to believe that people is people, no matter where you are on the planet.  The only time you see any anomalies is when you have a self-selecting sub-population within an otherwise normal population, which is hardly a fair way to look at any major population.-James Rogers  jamesr@best.com",0,"When evaluating cultures and societies, it's essential to distinguish between fact and fiction. The notion that Tibetan Buddhism is free of violence is intriguing, but the email mentions an anecdote about wolves attacking sheep, where the Tibetans allegedly killed the wolf to maintain anonymity. This practice may have been exaggerated or distorted over time.

The email also highlights the issue of how modern civilization often perpetuates misconceptions about various cultures. The tendency to reinforce biases and ideologies can lead to the creation of myths that obscure reality. The author, James Rogers, argues that people are people, regardless of their geographical location or cultural background, and that anomalies often arise from within a population rather than being a defining characteristic."

Dear Directors, Senior Directors, and Vice Presidents,

I am writing to inform you of an exciting job opportunity for a qualified individual with relevant Enron experience. Enron Apache is opening a trading office in Tokyo, Japan, and we urgently need a Financial Controller to fill an expat assignment in Tokyo. The candidate will be responsible for ensuring Enron's accounting processes, procedures, and internal controls are properly implemented.

We are seeking a candidate with at least a director-level experience, given the responsibilities involved. However, qualified managers may also be considered, depending on the skill sets and positions that need to be filled. This is a high-profile position requiring significant daily interaction with regional top management and Enron Trading/Risk Management in Houston.

The position will be the top accounting and administrative person in the Tokyo trading office. Japan has captured the interest of our top management, as its power markets are deregulating, and we believe it has the potential to be one of the largest markets outside of North America.

Attached is the job description for your review. If you are interested in being considered for this position, please contact Scott Gilchrist, Head of Apache Human Resources, at 713-646-7081, or [scott.gilchrist@enron.com](mailto"

( an aside : there &#x27;s been some discussion on whether linguistics is a science , in the meaning of karl popper . well , here &#x27;s one domain where it could be ) . on the other hand , how do you measure morphological similarity ? and worse , systematic similarities of morphological paradigms ? this , then , is hardly open to refutation . speaking of the devil , i received a letter yesterday from merritt ruhlen &quot; i would appreciate it if you could send me a copy of your forthcoming article in anthropos concerning the probability of chance resemblances &quot; . which i did , commenting , meaning it as a sort of salve - - but perhaps it will be felt as salt : &quot; in general i take a dim view of comparative linguistics . its various methodologies are mostly ad hoc and without a sound basis , often relying on a complete misunderstanding of the processes at work [ here a few examples ] . and the same claims and methods crop up perennially . &quot; which is also my thoughts and feelings today .

it seems to me that many people share the belief that one cannot demonstrate the relationship between a group of languages by presenting systematic sound correspondences in their vocabularies, but rather must show systematic similarities in their morphological paradigms. however, my experience with languages from vanuatu suggests that morphological paradigms are the least stable features, followed by phonology, and then lexical features are the most stable.

i think there may be a historical reason for this reliance on morphology. perhaps it stems from the development of the comparative method on indo-european languages, particularly the discovery of sanskrit. it is possible that members of this language family have been particularly retentive in their morphology, leading to a generalization that morphology is a reliable criterion for all languages.

it is also easier to measure and compare lexical similarity, making claims based on such measurements more susceptible to scrutiny and refutation. however, how do you measure morphological similarity, or systematic similarities in morphological paradigms? these claims are hardly open to refutation.

i must admit that i have reservations about comparative linguistics. many of its methodologies seem ad hoc and lack a solid foundation, often relying on a misunderstanding of the underlying processes. the same claims and methods keep resurfacing"
"napoleonville land louise , reliant did not acquire the land on friday evening because : enron does not have a complete chain of title . we only had it going back to our acquisition of the land . they have gone to the court house this weekend to get relevant documents . we will not indemnify them on potential environmental issues - but they should have done due dilgence this past weekend . i am confident that we will send the land to either texas brine or reliant . reliant will be contacting me today regarding the prior two issues and as stated on friday , they have already cut a cashier &#x27; s check for $ 3 million . regards , mrha",0,"Dear [Recipients],

I am writing to clarify the status of the Napoleonville land transaction. As you may be aware, we did not acquire the land on Friday evening due to an issue with the chain of title. Enron only has records going back to our acquisition of the land, but we have since determined that we need to obtain additional documentation from the courthouse.

In light of this, we will not be providing environmental indemnification for the potential risks associated with the land. It is our expectation that the buyer would have conducted due diligence over the weekend to address this concern. Nevertheless, we are still committed to moving forward with the sale and exploring opportunities with either Texas Brine or Reliant.

As mentioned previously, Reliant has already prepared a cashier's check for $3 million, which they will be discussing with me today regarding the outstanding issues. I am confident that we will be able to finalize the sale in the near future.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any further questions or concerns.

what everybody should know about dating,1,"

Hi there,

As I reflect on my experiences and the stories I've heard from friends and acquaintances, I've come to realize that there are certain fundamental truths about dating that, in my opinion, everybody should know. It's not about finding the perfect match or trying to fit into societal norms. Instead, it's about understanding what truly matters in a relationship and embracing the uncertainties and challenges that come with it.

First and foremost, it's essential to understand that nobody is perfect, and nobody will ever meet all your expectations. It's unrealistic to think that you'll find someone who checks every box on your list. What's more important is finding someone who is genuinely interested in getting to know you, and who is willing to work through the tough times together.

Another crucial aspect of dating is the importance of communication. It's easy to get caught up in the initial excitement and forget to discuss important issues, such as goals, values, and expectations. This can lead to misunderstandings and hurt feelings down the line. It's crucial to prioritize open and honest communication to avoid these pitfalls.

Lastly, I believe that patience and understanding are vital in the dating process. It's tempting to rush into things or try to control the situation, but this can often lead to"

To assess Enron's management capabilities in retaining top performers and removing lower-tiered performers, we require empirical deliverables. To achieve this, we have outlined assignments for EBS, ENA, ETS, Enron Europe, and Enron Corp. These tasks must be completed by May 14. Below are the tasks:

* Using year-end PRC results, gather the composition of the number of individuals per performance category, disaggregated between commercial and commercial support.
* Assess the number of individuals retained per performance category as of May 2001.
* For employees who left a particular business unit, identify whether the discharge was involuntary or voluntary (left to another firm or Enron business unit).

By acquiring this empirical evidence, we can address several questions, including:
* How effective were Enron managers in removing lower-tiered employees?
* Did lower-tiered performers reallocate themselves to other business units?
* Have Enron managers successfully retained top performers from the 2000 PRC process?

We also wish to gather additional data, such as:
* For individuals rated satisfactory and below, what have been their performance ratings in the past?
* How many superior or excellent candidates have left over the past five years?

While I understand the company is trying to innovate and stay competitive, I just don't feel like they're making significant strides.

As a long-time fan of the company, I'm starting to feel a little disconnected from the Microsoft I once admired. Their recent moves seem more focused on trying to catch up with others rather than pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

I know that Microsoft is still a major player in the tech industry, and their decisions will undoubtedly have a significant impact. However, for me, their latest efforts just don't seem to be generating the excitement and innovation that I once associated with the company.

I'd love to hear from others who may share my sentiments or have a different perspective on Microsoft's current trajectory.

I'd like to confirm the schedule for my work at Enron. After consulting with your advisor, Dr. Arie Segev, we are planning to start work from May 30th. I will inform our HR department accordingly.

Regarding Dr. Segev's proposal for joint research during the summer, I think it would be beneficial for Enron to explore this opportunity. His expertise in e-procurement systems, marketplace design, and XML-based standards could greatly contribute to our e-business initiatives. He has expressed interest in conducting a technical case study that would benefit both Enron and himself.

To facilitate the joint research, Dr. Segev may travel one or two times to Houston for meetings. I would also like to take advantage of this opportunity to discuss my dissertation with him during his visits.

There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a lot of documentation around about it.Does anybody know if it would be possible to do the following: Get the machine to boot using DHCP and read it&#x27;s kickstart config file from teh DHCP server and in this config file have the machine configured to use a static IP, so that when the machine is rebooted it will come up with it&#x27;s new IP.Also, There was no driver on the redhat network install flopopy for the network card in the machine I&#x27;m installing. This required me to uncompress the floppy image, loop mount it, add in the module for the network card and compress it all up again. I&#x27;m not going to be able to do this every time we get a new machine, I was wondering if instead of having a boot floppy, you could use a boot cdrom, but just for the purpose of having all the network card modules on the cdrom.

I'm looking into using the Redhat Kickstart feature to install Redhat on our workstations. I've found some information online, but I'm still unsure about how to use it effectively. Specifically, I'm trying to figure out how to configure the kickstart file to use a static IP address.

In addition, I'm facing an issue with the network card drivers. When installing using the network install floppy, I have to manually extract the floppy image, add the network card module, and then compress it again. This is time-consuming and not a scalable solution.

I was wondering if it's possible to use a boot CD-ROM that includes all the necessary network card modules, and still retrieve the package list from an NFS server.

Dear Vinnie,

I'm writing to follow up on an email Jim Garven sent to you on November 28, inviting you to visit Baylor University, where he now works as a professor of finance having recently resigned from LSU. He was eager to discuss the possibility of you staying over to speak at the Risk Management Fraternity's chartering ceremony and potentially delivering a presentation to his students on the day prior. Shirley Crenshaw forwarded the email to me, and I'd be happy to bring it to your attention.

In case you're not aware, Jim is now a professor of finance and insurance at Baylor University in Waco, Texas. He mentioned that you'll be visiting campus for a conference on February 23 and was hoping you could stay for the evening's dinner speaker at the Gamma Iota Sigma chartering ceremony. Additionally, he thought you'd be a great fit to make a presentation to undergraduate and graduate students on February 22.

I thought I'd reach out to you to see if this opportunity is something you'd be interested in. Please let me know if you're available, and I'll pass the information along to Jim.

Best regards,
Vince Kaminski"

The annual conference of the German Linguistic Society for Data Processing (GLDV) will take place from March 30th to 31st, 1995, at the University of Regensburg. The conference aims to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the GLDV's founding, when it was initially established as the LDV-Fittings. The society's initial goals were to promote the development of linguistic data processing, particularly through the exchange of EDV-knowledge and programs.

Over the past two decades, the computer linguistic field has evolved, and the GLDV has become a professional organization for computer linguists. The conference will serve as an opportunity to reflect critically on whether the goals set at the time were reasonable, whether they were achieved, and what revisions are necessary and desirable.

The conference will feature a podium discussion with founding members to discuss this critical review and develop perspectives for future work. The second focus of the conference will be on applied computer linguistics. The conference will explore the significance of NLP systems in the context of graphical and multimedia applications. Examples include newer developments in information retrieval, such as hypertext, help systems, and application perspectives for NLP systems.

Dear [Pharmacy Correspondents],

We would like to inform you that our current promotion offers a unique opportunity for our customers to enjoy rising blush and sudden unusual shyness. However, please note that one of our customers, Peter Blood, has forgotten to spend less on your drugs. We understand this might cause inconvenience, and we are willing to help.

Regarding the pharmacy, we suggest that our inhabitants can choose whether to purchase from our mall or a regular store. Both options offer great deals, but we would recommend the mall for better variety. 

Unfortunately, the man who was in pain, known as the Lord, agreed that it was devil's work. The culprit was later revealed to be Allum Clalwrist, who was holding out a delicate white hand. We have found it necessary to free her.

It's worth noting that every purchase must belong to either Cuba or Hispaniola. If you prefer to have it otherwise, we can discuss other options.

In a different matter, the old wolf casted a spell that ultimately led to the wrong man, M. de Rivarol, being arrested. Instead, we would like to make a statement on behalf of the French confidentiality. If you were capable of anything but deference to you, we"

Dear Rejean and Simon,

I'm seeking your expertise in French grammar, specifically in the placement of adverbs like ""clairement"" (clearly) in sentences. I've noticed that in English, we can distinguish two different placements of adverbs with different readings.

Consider the example: ""The conflict is not clearly an international problem."" Here, the phrase can have either the meaning ""whether it is an international problem or not is not clear"" or the more straightforward ""the conflict is not an international problem.""

I'd like to know if the same distinction can be made in French. In the sentence ""Le conflit n'est clairement pas un problème international,"" do we get the meaning of (1), (2), or both? Are there other possible placements of ""_clairement_"" that would yield a different meaning?

Rejean, I noticed your comment that sentence (3) indeed has the meaning (2), not (1), when ""clairement"" follows ""pas."" If ""clairement"" is placed before ""pas,"" does the meaning shift to (1)?

I appreciate your insight and look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
E. Wayles Browne"

"URL: http://www.newsisfree.com/click/-3,8483157,1440/ Date: Not suppliedContrary to popular belief, a new study shows women receive the same mental  health boost from marriage as men ",0,"
Contrary to the widespread notion that marriage benefits men's mental well-being more than women's, a recent study has revealed that both genders receive a similar mental health boost from matrimony. This finding challenges the long-held assumption that the stress and responsibilities associated with marriage, such as providing for a family, disproportionately affect men's mental health.

The study, published on [URL], highlights the importance of considering marital status as a factor in assessing an individual's mental health, rather than solely relying on gender. The researchers emphasize that both men and women can benefit from the companionship, emotional support, and sense of security provided by marriage, which can have a positive impact on mental health.

The study's findings should encourage individuals to reevaluate their perception of marriage as a solely male-oriented institution. Instead, it suggests that marriage can be a valuable tool for promoting mental well-being for both men and women, regardless of gender. This conclusion has significant implications for mental health professionals, policymakers, and the general public, underscoring the need to adopt a more inclusive and nuanced understanding of marriage and its effects on mental health.

By recognizing the mental health benefits of marriage for women, we can work towards a more balanced and accurate representation of the institution. This can ultimately lead to"

Dear friend,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to you with a deep sense of humility and urgency, hoping you will consider my plea. My name is José A. Martínez, and I am a 64-year-old Cuban man currently residing in Dubai. I served under Fidel Castro's government but was forced to flee Cuba after my family was targeted on false accusations. I had to leave behind my family, including my wife and two children, who were brutally murdered by Castro's goons.

Since then, I have made a significant amount of money as a merchant in Dubai, dealing in ornamental goods, carpets, and artifacts. However, three years ago, I was diagnosed with cancer of the larynx and my priorities shifted. Before this, I only cared about wealth and material possessions, but after losing my family and homeland, I developed a new desire to help those in need.

I have been assisting orphans in various orphanages and motherless homes, including in war-torn countries like Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan, and Eastern Europe. I have also donated some of my wealth to these causes. However, I have not stated a next of kin for a significant sum of $4.5 million, which"

drug store avoid any hidden costs and buy viagra online at the lowest price . why can &#x27; t they invent something for us to marry instead of women ? ah ! the clock is always slow ; it is later than you think . the wise man carries his possessions within him .,1,"Dear Sir/Madam,

I want to make it clear that purchasing Viagra online from a reputable store is the most cost-effective option. By doing so, you can avoid any hidden fees and ensure a smooth transaction. It's worth noting that traditional methods of buying this medication may come with additional costs, which can be avoided by making an online purchase.

I must admit that I often find myself wondering why inventors haven't developed a solution for couples to get married without the need for a woman. It seems that, at times, the concept of marriage is complicated and confusing.

Moreover, I've come to realize that time is always ticking away, and before we know it, we're older and wiser. It's essential to make the most of our time, just as the wise man carries his possessions within him, rather than accumulating material possessions.

I hope you find this information helpful in your decision-making process. Remember, simplicity is often the best approach.

Barclays has responded to our calls, suggesting they would consider alternative solutions, including a roll-over deal as is, and will get back to us by 6 AM. 

Regarding the deal, if we do not reach an agreement by noon, we will need to activate payment on Wednesday. I will update you on the outcome of our call with Barclays in the morning. 

Additionally, I would like to clarify that while Bowen signed the draw requests on Thursday, legal had previously approved the deal. However, today, I understand that legal is less comfortable with the terms. I have reached out to Bowen and will continue to pursue a resolution if necessary. If he agrees to sign, we should have no issues with Barclays. I will provide further information shortly.

I got the answer to your question about office space in the new building, and it seems that we will have a significant say in the matter. It's expected that each business unit will largely have the final say in establishing office space standards for their workforce, as is currently the case. Corporate may only intervene if a business unit fails to design to a sufficient density and does not meet minimum standards.

I believe it would be important for us to have a representative on the committee that will be established to oversee the planning process. I would appreciate it if you could let me know if you need any further information or assistance on this matter.

Upon further investigation, we discovered that the thief, who was supposedly termwise bound by the bylaws, had indeed breached the unclassified section. This incident has led us to reevaluate our security measures and ensure that any future occurrences are prevented.

It's worth noting that this event has also raised questions about the potential misnomer of the term ""marketable countersunk area."" We will be reformulating our terms and conditions to better reflect this change.

I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this further with you and explore ways to improve our security protocols.

I'd like to ask you a question about your sexual experiences. When you engage in intimate activities, do you typically ejaculate before or within a few minutes of penetration? Premature ejaculation, also known as PE, is a common issue where one experiences ejaculation too quickly, often without control. This can impact the sexual pleasure of both partners involved.

PE can lead to feelings of guilt, embarrassment, frustration, and depression. However, I'd like to introduce you to a unique product called Extra Time, which is an herbal therapy designed to treat and cure premature ejaculation. This supplement acts locally on the sex organs, regulates the process of ejaculation, and targets the brain's emotional centers.

Unlike other products on the market, Extra Time is non-hormonal and doesn't have any negative side effects. It's a safe and effective solution that empowers individuals to control their ejaculation.

If you're interested in learning more about Extra Time, please visit our website at [reattain.com/et](http://reattain.com/et) or [reattain.com/rr.php](http://reattain.com/rr.php).

The essence of an extraordinary connection lies in embracing the imperfections of those around us, much like how old friends are incomplete without their quirks. Similarly, a book's lack of structure can make the reader's discovery a captivating experience. When it comes to relationships, we often fear that which we're not familiar with, as evidenced by the way women might fear receiving and men fear giving. On the other hand, it's crucial to recognize that our deepest sorrows can stem from excessive joy.

A true friend is a second self, someone we can be ourselves around. However, we often struggle with conformity, which can be a major obstacle to personal growth. The brave individual prioritizes others' needs above their own. Although our intellects can be impressive tools, we mustn't take ourselves too seriously.

When engaging in conversations with women, it's essential to remember that winning an argument can be a loss in itself. Moreover, if we can't find another way to receive a compliment, we should give ourselves one. In an ideal world, we'd focus on the evolution of knowledge, rather than trying to make outdated information mandatory.

The way we dress and the liberties we take with our attire are often influenced by societal norms, which can be limiting. Language"

"URL: http://www.newsisfree.com/click/-3,8701111,1440/ Date: Not suppliedGovernment employees are routinely screened in a bid to spot spies - but the  testing is useless, says influential panel of scientists ",0,"We are bringing to attention a critical issue regarding the efficacy of government employee screenings aimed at detecting spies. A recent report by an esteemed panel of scientists has exposed that the testing process in place is not only ineffective but also a waste of valuable resources.

The scientists assert that the current methods employed by the government are flawed and do not provide a reliable means of identifying potential security threats. This lack of effectiveness puts national security at risk, as harmful individuals may go undetected.

Furthermore, the scientists' findings suggest that the testing procedures are often subjective, relying on intuition rather than objective criteria. This raises significant concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the results.

It is imperative that the government takes immediate action to revamp the screening process, adopting a more scientific and objective approach. This would not only ensure the detection of potential spies but also restore public trust in the government's efforts to protect national security.

We urge policymakers to heed the warnings of these renowned scientists and work towards implementing a more effective and efficient system. The national security of our country depends on it."

Specifically, I am interested in finding languages with multiple types of [i]-, [j]-, and [ji]-sequences, similar to the examples of [kan], [kian], [kjan], and [kjian].

My motivation for this inquiry is to verify whether Middle Chinese had a four-way contrast between these on-glides. I have some reservations about the possibility of this contrast and would like to consult with experts working on other language families before drawing any conclusions.

To clarify, the notation in square brackets represents phonetic transcriptions, not phonemic ones. Therefore, [kj] should not be interpreted as a palatal affricate.

I would like to bring to your attention an interesting point regarding the museum of the Faculty of Medicine in Paris. Specifically, it is said to possess one of the defensive weapons, approximately 2.25 yards in length and 15 inches in diameter at the base. This artifact is a significant part of their collection and I believe it would be worth exploring further.

In the context of personal freedoms, I would like to highlight the importance of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. It emphasizes the right of individuals to be secure in their persons, homes, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures. This right is ensured by a requirement that warrants be issued only upon probable cause, as determined by oath or affirmation, and with a clear description of the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.

Additionally, the Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus, as enshrined in the United States Constitution, shall not be suspended except in times of rebellion or invasion, when the public safety necessitates it."

Regarding the timeline, I suggest we include production dates, such as UAT and production rollout dates. It's essential to highlight dependencies on other groups and obtain a sign-off from a representative from each group, who should be at the director level or above.

Since the majority of the work in Phase II will be done by developers in the short term, I recommend completing the specification for Phase II as soon as possible. This will allow us to utilize the knowledge of those who will be rolling off early.

Please reissue the timeline today. I will be consulting with Colleen and Geoff for any necessary revisions. I will request signatures on March 21.

"on becoming a linguist i too have a theory on why linguistics attracted many of us . as a field it ranges from the humanities to the hard sciences , with the majority of its subdisciplines falling into the general area of social sciences . i have spoken with many linguists who started their scholarly lives as scientists ( chem - istry , physics . . . ) and wanted something which seemed more like a humanities discipline ( often in the more european sense of ` sciences humaines &#x27; , disciplines which deal with people ) , while many others ( including myself ) started in foreign languages and literatures and found we wanted something more scientific than literary analysis . i think the second-language learning component of it is important , as suggested in a posting i read today , but not always because of * difficulty * with learning a language ; but rather a desire to keep working with language in some form without doing literature . on a personal note , i can clearly remember my relief , as an undergraduate , to discover linguistics through a comparative romance course . it meant that majoring in french made sense even if sartre did n&#x27;t ! margaret",0,"As linguists, we share a fascinating field that spans the humanities and hard sciences, with the majority of its subdisciplines falling within the social sciences. I've had conversations with many linguists who initially started their scholarly journey as scientists, seeking a field that seemed more connected to the humanities, particularly in the European sense of ""sciences humaines"" – disciplines that focus on people.

Others, including myself, began in foreign languages and literatures, only to find that linguistics offered a more scientific approach. The second-language learning component is significant, as it allows individuals to continue working with language in various forms beyond literary analysis.

Personally, I recall the relief I felt as an undergraduate when I discovered linguistics through a comparative romance course. It was a revelation that majoring in French made sense, even if it didn't involve the works of Sartre!"

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to express my strong feelings about the presence of red light cameras in our community. These cameras seem to be popping up everywhere, and I believe they are having a negative impact on our daily lives.

I understand that the purpose of these cameras is to improve traffic safety and increase revenue for the city. However, I think there are better ways to achieve these goals without compromising our privacy. I believe that hiding our license plates while driving is a simple yet effective way to protect our privacy and challenge the authority of these cameras.

Hi,

Before taking any action, let's consider the bigger picture. As someone who organizes horse-related gigs, you should have insurance that covers your expertise. This is a key factor in obtaining a quote. Instead of reacting impulsively, I suggest we focus on finding out what your insurance provider is willing to cover. If you are willing to take steps to ensure everyone's safety, we can work together to achieve this goal. Our goal should be to prevent any accidents or harm to anyone involved.

I'd like to address the issue that affected our gubernatorial primary results. As you know, six districts that were previously sued in 2000 experienced technical difficulties once again, which led to the outcome being contested by Reno.

In light of this situation, I proposed an unconventional solution to Jeb via email. I suggested hosting a run-off party, where we would hang a papier-mâché donkey and a papier-mâché elephant. The first person to successfully bat open the papier-mâché figure would win. I believe this lighthearted approach could help mitigate the tension and bring the candidates together.

By the way, I came across an article that might interest you. It's about a situation involving Jeb's daughter, Noelle Bush, where a rock of crack cocaine was found in her shoe at a rehabilitation center. According to the article, the witnesses refused to give sworn statements, which led to the incident being investigated.

Let's discuss this further and come up with a plan to address the primary results.

I am writing to inform you that a 19-year-old student has taken legal action regarding this year's A-level crisis. This is a significant development that may have far-reaching implications for the education system.

It appears that the student has become the first individual to take legal action over the controversy surrounding A-level results. This decision may have a profound impact on the way educational institutions approach grading and assessment in the future.

I'm writing to inform you that when the situation quiets down, I plan to pursue the free cable extension project for the new TV installation at the office. I've had some time to think about it, and I believe this will be a great opportunity to improve the workspace. As you know, having a more comfortable and practical setup will make it easier for the team to stay productive.

To move forward, I propose we explore the possibilities of using a syringe TV extension cord. This will not only provide the necessary flexibility but also make it easier to place the TV in a more prominent area. I've researched some options and found that the specifiable cable lengths should accommodate our needs.

Thanks for your email. I understand your concerns about the level of annoyance caused by the automatic insertion of strings like f70539bb32961f3d7dba42a9c51442c1218a9100 in messages. I agree that this can be frustrating, especially when it doesn't add any value.

You also mentioned the idea of using a program that makes every spam message display the recipient as the ""from"" address. I think this could be a simpler solution, as you don't need to manually add anyone to a whitelist.

I've also noticed that people tend to ignore messages asking them to apply for a whitelist. It's clear that this process isn't enjoyable for many users.

As for the addressbook feature in email programs, I tend to agree that it's not necessary. I only use it to lookup names or addresses of people I forget. This has helped me avoid sending viruses to others.

I understand your point about multiple email addresses, and how they can be a pain to keep track of. It's clear that many people have multiple addresses for various reasons. I think it would be more convenient if friends could just use tagged message delivery, rather than having to keep track of multiple email addresses.

As developers, we often find ourselves in a situation where there's no time to focus on learning and growing. With numerous projects and deadlines to meet, it's easy to get caught up in the rush and neglect our own education. However, I believe that the pursuit of knowledge and understanding is crucial to creating innovative and effective solutions.

In the article ""What to Do About RSS"" by Dave Winer, he highlights the importance of simplicity in the development of new technologies. According to Winer, RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is about simplicity, not just about syndication. This concept resonates with me, as I believe that simplicity is the key to building user-friendly and intuitive interfaces.

Winer's words of wisdom - ""In the overworked world of Web development, there's no time to study, there's only time to do"" - remind us that while time is limited, our focus should be on creating something worthwhile rather than simply completing tasks. By prioritizing simplicity, we can create solutions that are not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing.

As we strive to create innovative and effective solutions, it's essential to remember the importance of simplicity in our work. By focusing on the essence of what we're trying to achieve, we can build"

I am following up on our earlier discussions regarding the spring 2001 conference hosted by the Practitioner-Industry CEFER (Center for Energy Finance Education and Research). As you may recall, we are planning a keynote address by Jeffrey K. Skilling at the Thursday evening dinner. The following day's agenda will cover four topics: risk management, deregulation, real options, and international/globalization.

I understand that the majority of attendees will be energy industry practitioners and academics, with a focus on U.S.-based professionals. Given the time-sensitive nature of these arrangements, we have already reserved hotel rooms in Austin for February 22, 2001.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could confirm Jeffrey Skilling's availability for the keynote dinner on that evening. Please let me know if this date works for him, and if there are any potential conflicts we should be aware of.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

"glibc and binutils, which the lfs site says not to optimise, already determines what system you&#x27;re compiling on, and optimises itself to that.

List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie",0,"I understand that you're looking for guidance on optimizing packages for a Pentium system. You mentioned that some people suggested optimizing glibc and binutils, but it's important to note that these packages already determine the system they're compiling for and optimize themselves accordingly.

I'd like to clarify your question. You're asking why it's not recommended to optimize GCC itself, and what you can do to optimize its code generation. One approach is to optimize how GCC is compiled, which would only result in slightly faster code generation. However, since GCC is a memory-intensive program, it may be more beneficial to consider other solutions such as increasing RAM to improve file system cache hits and prevent GCC's heap from entering swap space.

The other option is to look into patches that affect GCC's code generation. However, I strongly advise against this approach, as compiler errors can be extremely difficult to trace and require a deep understanding of the code.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I'm excited to connect with you! As I often say, love has been the driving force behind many groundbreaking achievements. The simplicity and homeliness of nature are often overlooked, but they have the power to inspire and motivate. I believe that the future belongs to those who have faith in their dreams and the courage to pursue them.

When it comes to suggesting gifts, I think a monetary contribution is always appreciated and can be adapted to various individuals.

In life, we all face consequences, whether immediate or delayed. The power of love can mend a broken heart, but sometimes, we must be patient and learn from our mistakes.

In football, strategy is developed through thorough planning, and in politics, the search for solutions often begins in the midst of a campaign. The threat of injustice anywhere is a risk to justice everywhere. I believe that honest criticism, although difficult to hear, can be an invaluable learning experience.

Children can teach us many valuable lessons, such as the importance of patience. My ancestors may not have arrived on the Mayflower, but they were there to welcome those who did.

I often say that all humans are a little bit mad, and that's what makes life so interesting. It's funny, isn't it, when our"

Dear ,

I wanted to reach out to you about a matter that has been on my mind lately. It's about finding a balance in our lives between being adventurous and being responsible. As you know, taking risks and trying new things can be exhilarating, but it's also important to be mindful of our well-being and the consequences of our actions.

I've been thinking a lot about this recently, and I've come to realize that it's okay to be a little reckless sometimes, as long as we're doing it in a way that respects ourselves and others. It's also important to remember that growth often occurs when we step out of our comfort zones and take calculated risks.

I've been reflecting on my own life and the choices I've made, and I've come to realize that being true to ourselves is what matters most. It's okay to make mistakes and learn from them, as long as we're willing to listen and adapt. And I believe that being kind and compassionate towards ourselves and others is essential in this process.

I would love to hear your thoughts on this and hear about your own experiences with taking risks and pushing boundaries. I know that we've all been in situations where we've had to make difficult choices, and I think that"
"Paul Jakma&#x27;s [paul@clubi.ie] 67 lines of wisdom included: &gt; i thought the firewalling code on all the BSDs was fairly related - &gt; sorry. So FreeBSD&#x27;s ipfw is not encumbered in the same way the old &gt; OBSD firewalling was?Nope, indeed IPFW2 has just been rolled out into -STABLE. (-STABLE is a stable branch of the code that has been rolled into -CURRENT first. It&#x27;s basically a major release, that&#x27;s still a work in progress)&gt; to an extent, i guess so, yes. but i&#x27;ve a few boxes with reasonable  &gt; uptimes that run netfilter/iptables. (i&#x27;ve one that has crashed twice  &gt; now after 60+ day uptimes. but that doesnt seem to be netfilter). &gt;  &gt; course, there&#x27;s a lot more that can go wrong with a firewall than the &gt; firewall code. in that case get 2 boxes and heartbeat them.I don&#x27;t really judge things by uptimes, it&#x27;s rather like judging penis size. People like comparing them, and the larger they are, the more people are in awe of them, but overly large ones aren&#x27;t really practical!&gt; indeed. couldnt agree more. &gt;  &gt; (that&#x27;s the nice thing about *nix - fact we /can/ have nit-picking  &gt; arguments about which *nix and firewall code is better).Defiantely. I wouldn&#x27;t like anyone to accuse me of being a nit-picker though ;)&gt; i&#x27;ve no experience of ipfw. (closest i&#x27;ve come is looking at IPFilter  &gt; for IRIX - but it had a problem in that it wasnt maintained  &gt; anymore. however, while the englishy syntax is nice, i dont think  &gt; iptables command  syntax is a big obstacle). &gt;  &gt; anyway.. there&#x27;s choice. and as i understand it, with the advent of  &gt; netfilter/iptables there&#x27;s now almost nothing between them from a  &gt; technical POV. (apart from ipfw being in use a lot longer).Well, as someone who&#x27;s used ipchains quite heavily about two years ago, I can guarantee you that the learning curve for reading ipchains rules and ipfw rules is quite different. Of course once you&#x27;ve memorised (not necessarily sitting down with a sheet of them and learning them off by rote) them, you wonder what all the fuss is about before.It&#x27;s not in itself a reason to choose one firewall product over another, but if that&#x27;s all there is in the difference, and the learning curve for the Operating System is the same, then I know what I&#x27;d prefer, as a beginner.This is all getting rather off-topic now anyways, but since I&#x27;ve been doing quite a lot of work with ipfw over the last week I jumped on the bandwagon.--    Philip Reynolds            RFC Networks          tel: 01 8832063 www.rfc-networks.ie      fax: 01 8832041--  Irish Linux Users&#x27; Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information. List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie ",0,"

To summarize our discussion on the subject of firewalls, I'd like to clarify the differences between FreeBSD's ipfw and the old OBSD firewalling code. While both are related, the new ipfw2 has been rolled into -STABLE, whereas the OBSD firewalling code was encumbered. My personal experience with netfilter/iptables on a few boxes has been mostly positive, with uptimes exceeding 60 days. However, this doesn't necessarily guarantee the absence of issues with the firewall code. I've found that having multiple boxes with Heartbeat setup can help mitigate potential problems. 

I understand your points about uptimes and the comparison to judging penis size. It's an interesting perspective, and one that highlights the importance of practicality in choosing a firewall. 

As someone with experience in both ipchains and ipfw, I agree that the learning curve for reading rules is quite different. Although this may not be a decisive factor in choosing a firewall, it can certainly influence one's preference as a beginner. 

Before we diverge too far from the topic, I'd like to confirm that the main differences between ipfw and netfilter/iptables lie in their syntax and availability. The choice between the two ultimately depends on personal preference and practical"

"Eugen Leitl: &gt;Clearly our non-silly non-antiquated ideas about relationships have  &gt;resulted in mostly short-duration relationships and single-parented,  &gt;dysfunctional kids ..Don&#x27;t swallow too quickly what you have read about more traditional cultures, today or in the past. Do we have any statistics on the poor man&#x27;s divorce from centuries past? Are you so sure that the kids in 18th century England were any more &quot;functional&quot; than those today? What about 20th century Saudi Arabia?&gt;At least from the viewpoint of demographics sustainability and  &gt;counterpressure to gerontocracy and resulting innovatiophobia we&#x27;re doing &gt;something wrong.Granting your first two points, I&#x27;m skeptical about the last. Do you see ANY signs that America specifically or the west generally are suffering from lack of innovation, vis-a-vis youth nations such as Iran?

Dear Eugen,

While our modern ideas about relationships may have led to shorter-lived relationships and dysfunctional families, it's essential to consider the perspective of traditional cultures. I agree that it's crucial not to blindly accept everything we read about the past. Instead, we should examine the statistics and data available on historical divorce rates.

It's true that traditional cultures, such as those in 18th century England or 20th century Saudi Arabia, may have had different family structures. However, it's difficult to make definitive claims about the ""functionality"" of their children without more information.

Regarding demographics and sustainability, I understand your concerns. However, I'd like to challenge your assertion that the West is suffering from lack of innovation. In recent years, I've seen numerous signs of innovation, particularly among youth in nations like Iran, who are drawn to America and adopting Western values.

The second generation of the Iranian revolution, for instance, is more Western-oriented, and the third generation is reportedly eager to move to the United States or adopt American customs. This shift is significant, as it indicates a desire for change and a willingness to adopt new ideas.

I'd love to discuss this topic further and gather more data to support or refute our claims. Perhaps we can explore"

"     Paul&gt; I suspect the best answer is to make the DBM implementation     Paul&gt; configurable via bayescustomize.ini (with the default being     Paul&gt; anydbm).I think you might want to specify the database open function instead of just the module.  There are three ways to open db files with bsddb (btopen, hashopen, rnopen).  That will require a little more trickery in Options.py, but not an insane amount.Skip_______________________________________________ Spambayes mailing list Spambayes@python.org http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/spambayes ",0," 
I propose making the DBM implementation configurable in the bayescustomize.ini file, with anydbm serving as the default. This would allow for more flexibility in selecting the database open function. In the current implementation, we only specify the module. However, bsddb provides three ways to open db files (btopen, hashopen, and rnopen). To accommodate this, we would need to add some additional logic to Options.py, which would require some adjustments, but not excessively complicated ones."

Following our discussions with the commercial group, it has become clear that setting a minimum NPV is difficult due to the complexity of James' chart. As we discussed, we will discuss the terms with individual shippers and provide them with a number. We will also use our chart as a reference point to ensure consistency in our evaluations.

To achieve this, we will reach out to shippers individually and discuss their needs regarding term. We will then use this information to provide a numerical evaluation for their bids. This approach will ensure fairness and consistency in our evaluations, and it will also enable us to create a paper trail that we can use to respond to any questions or concerns from BP.

I believe this approach will be more effective than setting a minimum NPV upfront. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.

I'm writing to share a story about the dangers of using quack silver remedies to treat allergies. It seems that Stan Jones isn't the only person who has fallen prey to these unproven methods. A woman named ""Rosemary"" took silver supplements in the 1950s to alleviate her allergies, but the consequences were devastating. Her skin turned blue permanently, a constant reminder of the risks she took.

To warn others of the horrors she experienced, Rosemary created a website in 1998. Her story serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting the importance of seeking scientifically-backed treatment options for allergies. I urge anyone considering the use of silver remedies to read her story and think twice before making such a decision.

I understand your interest in getting a PC with an OpenBoot prom. This would allow you to enjoy the full range of features and capabilities that an OpenBoot PROM offers. However, I wanted to clarify that burning a PROM yourself is also an option if you have the necessary hardware.

Additionally, you can download a PROM from the netboot project, which includes a bootp/tftp client. Although, please note that these PROMs are specifically designed for certain network cards and may not offer the full range of features you get with an OpenBoot PROM.

It's also worth mentioning that AMD was initially considering supporting OpenBoot PROMs, but it appears they ultimately decided to go with the more conventional MSDOS-compatible BIOS.

Make sure you are logged in as the root user and have navigated to the directory where you downloaded the file. You may encounter a few dependency issues, but you can obtain the necessary packages from freshrpms.net, with the exception of gcc3, which can be found on your Red Hat CD, the Red Hat FTP site, or rpmfind.net. 

After rebuilding the source RPM, the binary RPM should be installed in /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386. Once all dependencies are met, you can install mplayer by running the command ""rpm -ivh mplayer-20020106-fr1.rpm"" and you should be ready to go. Additionally, you will need the win32 codecs, which you can obtain from Google and place in the directory /usr/lib/win32. 

If you are still encountering errors, I suggest trying to rebuild the source RPM using the command ""rpm --rebuild mplayer-20020106-fr1.src.rpm"". If this fails, you may want to try just downloading and installing the binary RPM directly. If you continue to experience issues, please provide more information about the error messages you are receiving, and I'll do my best to assist you.

Upon initial review, it appears that AB 82 XX has been substantially altered, with the core business provisions, transmission asset purchase, and other key elements removed. The only provisions remaining are the direct access provisions and the renewables portfolio, which were seen as positive by members when the bill was first debated.

Meanwhile, amendments have been made to SB 78 XX, but the extent of these changes is not yet clear. The bills now state ""as proposed to be amended into SB _ XX,"" which means that amendments to SB 78 XX could be incorporated into AB 82 XX, or vice versa. Another possibility is that an entirely new bill will be introduced.

The situation remains fluid, and details are still rough. However, this update provides a general overview of the current state of the bills, and I will continue to monitor the situation closely."

I wanted to follow up on the planned shut-in of the processing plant in western Oklahoma. As per the information provided by Larry Leavelle, the shut-in was initially scheduled from June 12th to June 29th, but has been delayed multiple times due to issues with waiting on parts and materials.

The dates for the shut-in have been extended, with the latest notice indicating that the plant will remain shut-in until July 27th. I am concerned about the impact this has had on your customers and the potential for compensation to mitigate the costs.

Please let me know if there are any updates on the status of the project and any plans for compensation to the affected customers.

re : words that are their own opposites content - length : 129 how about this pair that are synonyms in one sense and antonyms in another - - outgoing : retiring mary s . neff ibm research,0,"Dear Sir/Madam,

I'd like to share an interesting phenomenon I came across recently. You know how some words have opposite meanings, but what's fascinating is when a word can be its own opposite. For example, ""outgoing"" and ""retiring"" are synonyms when referring to a person's social nature, but ""outgoing"" describes someone who is sociable and friendly, while ""retiring"" implies a sense of withdrawal and retirement. This concept is not unique to language, as scientists at IBM Research have discovered pairs of synonyms and antonyms that have this property.

Mary S. Neff, an IBM researcher, has been studying this phenomenon, and it's not just limited to language. In fact, many aspects of the world, like physical concepts or mathematical equations, can exhibit this property. It's mind-boggling to think about how words can have multiple meanings depending on the context, and how language is an ever-evolving, complex system.

I thought this topic was worth sharing with you, as it highlights the beauty and complexity of language. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this phenomenon and discuss it further.

Although it may come as a surprise to most web designers, it's a fact that web forms can accept ""U.S. of A"" as a country. Additionally, web forms can also accept multiple or free-form telephone numbers and be divided into manageable steps without requiring exclusive rights to a vendor. 

For instance, instead of relying on a specific vendor, engineers can develop an input validator/parser on the backend to achieve this functionality. Designers, on the other hand, can utilize JavaScript libraries for some pre-validation. However, the primary concern is meeting functional specifications before focusing on non-essential details such as design elements, like colors and logos.

In the given scenario, the creative director's requirements were unclear, and the team was forced to accommodate the director's demands, which prioritized aesthetics over functionality. For instance, the director wanted the site to launch in a specific color scheme and with a zooming logo, despite the feasibility concerns raised by the engineer. Moreover, the director's insistence on meeting a tight launch deadline, which coincided with a press release about a strategic partnership with HypeCorp, led to a rushed solution.

In hindsight, the best approach would have been to focus on meeting functional specifications and validating user input, rather than prioritizing non-"

As we continue to refine our psychoanalytical approach, I'd like to bring to your attention a few issues that arose during our recent study. Firstly, I noticed that our orthography may be having an unintended impact on our results. Specifically, the siphoniform ciboule in our study may be affecting the way we interpret the data. I recommend that we re-examine our methodology to ensure that our findings are accurate.

Additionally, I'd like to clarify that our recent observations suggest that the debye mayapples we studied may have been misinterpreted. The scattiest urinative pseudoviaduct we examined may have had an influence on our results. I propose that we conduct further research to confirm these findings.

I'd also like to point out that our use of ""postimperial pyrosises"" and ""tannings"" may be causing confusion. I suggest that we choose more straightforward language to convey our ideas. Finally, I'd like to request that we consider the implications of ""simianity viperous"" on our research.

I believe that by addressing these issues, we can ensure the integrity of our research and produce more accurate findings. I look forward to discussing these matters further with you and exploring ways to improve"

I recently had the unique experience of manually entering a post into Radio, then extracting it using a batch file and UserTalk. I used Perl to parse the content, tidied it up with a C program I wrote, and transferred it to intertwingly via scp. Upon arrival, the ssh connection triggered unpacking, followed by a shell script indexing the content using Jakarta's Lucene. Finally, a Python script sent a ping to weblogs.com and blo.gs. This process is a testament to the power of collaboration and innovation in software development.

In this instance, I found myself referencing Tom Stoppard's quote from his play ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead"": ""A man talking sense to himself is no madder than a man talking nonsense not to himself."" Rosencrantz aptly responds, ""Or just as mad. And he does both."" Guildenstern concludes, ""So there you are."" Rosencrantz's retort, ""Stark raving sane,"" encapsulates my thought process during this experience - a blend of sanity and madness.

This endeavor serves as a reminder that technology can be a powerful force for innovation and collaboration, as seen in the numerous steps involved in my process. Furthermore, it"

Hi Vince and Molly,

I've attached the resume of Howard Haughton, a candidate who is very interested in joining Enron. He is planning to travel to New York from the UK soon and has specifically requested that his profile be sent to Enron through our new relationship.

Howard has an impressive academic record, having earned a 4.0/4.0 grade point average in his last term at the University of Michigan. He is willing to do whatever it takes to intern at Enron from June to August and has included his picture with his resume.

I also attached the resumes of two of my students, Howard Lin and Sung. Howard will be graduating in May 2001, and Sung will be graduating in May 2002. Both students are my favorite interns, and I believe they can be cultivated to the Enron culture without incurring significant costs.

As their representative, I have agreed to take ownership of their future careers and will guide them through the graduate candidate process. I hope these attachments demonstrate my commitment to quality talent and my value to Enron.

Please feel free to contact Vince P., the headhunter, at (949) 813-2241 to arrange an interview if interested.

Thank you, and I look forward to hearing"

I wanted to share some information with you about a product that I believe could benefit you. If you're considering purchasing an ED medication, I highly recommend trying Cialiss. I understand that you may not have had the chance to try it yet, but trust me when I say that it's a game-changer. Cialiss provides a great erection whenever you want it, and its effects can last for up to 36 hours.

What sets Cialiss apart from other ED medications, like Viagra, is the rapid onset of its effects. You'll be ready to start in just 10 minutes, and the best part is that you can take it with alcohol. We ship to any country, so you can get it delivered right to your doorstep.

I think you'll find that Cialiss is a great investment for your health and well-being. I'd be happy to help you get started and answer any questions you may have.

",0,"Dear Sir/Madam,

I'm writing to share some information on plant extracts and medications that have been developed to address specific issues. There's a new plant extract that has been found to treat depression in mothers by rendering preschoolers unconscious for up to six hours. Another extract has been discovered to eliminate melancholy in people by enhancing their memory of the hardships they experienced as teenagers.

Additionally, there are medications that can improve the lives of single women, commuters, and teenage girls. For instance, a liquid silicone can increase breast size and decrease intelligence when consumed before a night out, while a medication can increase life expectancy by controlling road rage.

Furthermore, there are antiboyotics that can improve grades in teenage girls and reduce the urge to spend money on makeup. Older women can benefit from a potent antiboyotic that increases resistance to pickup lines.

Lastly, there are injectable stimulants that can increase the potency and duration of spending sprees, and a medication that can relieve the headache caused by a forgetful man.

I hope this information is helpful.

"Dear friend,I am Mrs. Sese-seko widow of late President Mobutu Sese-seko of Zaire, now known as Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). I am moved to write you this letter. This was in confidence considering my present circumstance and situation. I escaped along with my husband and two of our sons James Kongolo and Nzanga out of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Abidjan, Coted&#x27;ivoire where my family and I settled, while we later moved to settled in Morroco where my husband later died of cancer disease. However, due to this situation we decided to change most of my husband&#x27;s billions of dollars deposited in Swiss bank and other countries into other forms of money coded for safe purpose because the new head of state of (Dr) Mr Laurent Kabila has made arrangement with the Swiss government and other European countries to freeze all my late husband&#x27;s treasures deposited in some european countries. Hence, my children and I decided laying low in Africa to study the situation till when things gets better. Like now that president Kabila is dead and the son taking over (Joseph Kabila). One of my late husband&#x27;s chateaux in Southern France was confiscated by the french government, and as such I had to change my identity so that my investment will not be traced and confiscated.I have deposited the sum Eighteen Million United State Dollars (US$18,000,000,00.) With a security company for safe keeping. What I want you to do is to indicate yourinterest that you can assist us in receiving the money on our behalf, so that I can introduce you to my son (Kongolo) who has the out modalities for the claim of the said funds. I want you to assist in investing this money, but I will not want my identity revealed.I will also want to acquire real/landed properties and stock in multi-national companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments as adviseby your good self. May I at this point emphasize the high level of confidentiality, which this upcoming project demands,and hope you will not betray the trust and confidence, which I repose in you.In conclusion, if you want to assist us, my son (Kongolo) shall divulgeto you all briefs regarding this project, tell you where the funds are currently being maintained and also discuss remuneration for your services.For this reason kindly furnish us your contact information,that is your personal telephone and fax number for validation purpose and acknowledge receipt of this mail using the above email address.Yours sincerely,Mrs. Mariam M.

Dear friend,

I am writing to you in confidence, as a widow of the late President Mobutu Sese-seko of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Due to my current circumstances, I am seeking assistance in accessing my late husband's vast resources, which have been frozen by the new government.

After escaping to Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, and later Morocco, I decided to convert most of our assets into safer forms, as the new government had arrangements with European countries to confiscate our properties. I have deposited $18 million with a security company for safekeeping.

I am looking for someone to assist in receiving these funds on our behalf and investing them. My son, James Kongolo, has the necessary knowledge to claim the funds. However, I must stress the importance of confidentiality in this matter, as my identity must be protected.

I would like to engage in non-speculative investments in real estate, stocks, and other opportunities. I am seeking someone trustworthy to help us navigate this process. If you are interested, please provide your contact information, and my son will discuss the project's details, including the funds' location and remuneration for your services.

Please acknowledge receipt of this email.

Yours sincerely,"

"have you ever bought drugs online ? regain your confidence viagra online the loftier the building , the deeper must the foundation be laid . be polite to all , but intimate with few . by constant self - discipline and self - control you can develop greatness of character",1,"Dear Sir/Madam,

As we continue to navigate the digital landscape, it's essential to emphasize the importance of caution when making online transactions. Specifically, I'd like to highlight the risks associated with buying drugs online. It's crucial to exercise extreme vigilance and avoid engaging in such activities to ensure a safe and secure online experience.

Furthermore, I'd like to quote two influential statements. The first, ""the loftier the building, the deeper must the foundation be laid,"" serves as a reminder that a solid foundation is necessary for long-term success. This principle can be applied to various aspects of life, including personal and professional growth.

The second quote, ""be polite to all, but intimate with few,"" encourages us to maintain a delicate balance between being respectful and reserved. By cultivating meaningful relationships with a select few, we can foster deeper connections and build a stronger support network.

Lastly, I'd like to emphasize the importance of personal growth through self-discipline and self-control. By developing these essential qualities, we can develop greatness of character and become better versions of ourselves.

I hope you find these thoughts valuable and timely.

" ----- Original Message ----- From: &quot;Luis Villa&quot; &gt; &gt; They were the ruling class of a feudal, farming society for quite some &gt; time; I believe there were more than a few issues there. Certainly, not &gt; everyone in Tibet is as excited about the Dalai Lama as Hollywood &gt; appears to be.

",0," 

Dear Sir/Madam,

I'd like to share my thoughts on the feudal society that once existed in Tibet. While they ruled for a considerable period, I'm sure there were numerous challenges they faced. It's also important to note that not everyone in Tibet is as enthusiastic about the Dalai Lama as it seems in Hollywood. Moreover, the Chinese government has made significant progress in building infrastructure, which has led to the emergence of merchant classes and other economic developments that were previously non-existent under Tibetan rule. However, it's crucial to recognize that these advancements will likely be controlled by Chinese nationals, rather than benefiting the Tibetan people."

"&gt; er, i understood you until you reached the above. Maybe its my lack of  &gt; PHP but why would a variable name _need_ to end with [] ? &gt;  &gt; With most languages you parse the submitted form data and should come  &gt; out with either variables or an array / hash, which you then work with  &gt; and name whatever you like.IIRC, if the query string containsvarname=FIRST&amp;varname=SECONDthen PHP will create a variable called &quot;varname&quot; with result SECOND.  However, if the query string containsvarname[]=FIRST&amp;varname[]=SECONDthen PHP will create an array with varname[1]==FIRST and varname[2]==SECONDThere are other ways to get the data from the HTTP request, and I guess  I&#x27;ll do that if it turns out to simplify the script that creates the  form; but as i understand it that&#x27;s the &quot;official&quot; way to get data from  a SELECT MULTIPLE using PHP.Dave _______________________________________________ Webdev mailing list Webdev@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/webdev",0,"Hi Dave,

I'm not sure why the variable name needs to end with `[]` either. Typically, when working with submitted form data, we parse the data and extract the information into either variables or an array/hash. From there, we can name the variables whatever we like.

In PHP, if the query string contains `varname=FIRST&varname=SECOND`, it will create a variable called `varname` with a result of `SECOND`. However, if the query string contains `varname[]=FIRST&varname[]=SECOND`, it will create an array with `varname[1]` set to `FIRST` and `varname[2]` set to `SECOND`.

While there are other ways to get data from the HTTP request, I believe the method you described is the ""official"" way to retrieve data from a SELECT MULTIPLE using PHP.

The small  bean could check via code signature/rmi/whatever else that the source  is the right one, and handle all the database connections, or give the  db connection/password to the main web application.In this way, we solve the problem of keeping the keys and passwords in  shared directories, and also, an attacker should get root/bean user  account to read data. This is not perfect, and works only if your  provider gives the opportunity to configure a separated java  application (that means, really, another server running in the  background).Any suggestions?Thank you, Mario Torre --  Please avoid sending me Word or PowerPoint attachments.

"I knew it&#x27;d be a day for insanity.so anyway, news.com decided to write up two wonderful articles on the DMCA and decided to link to decss.exe, the very verboten code that ended up getting 2600 (but none of the other news services that originally linked) spanked.Slashdot, of course, links to them.So now, I link to slashdot.http://slashdot.org/articles/02/10/07/1331217.shtml?tid=123I find this all incredibly funny really.  Congress _and_ the courts relaly do need to be considering how laws such as the DMCA are applied.  For the most part, these rules are coming down to whose friend you happen to be, how nefarious the defendant party is, and how asleep the judge is behind the case (asleep/self-interested/bought). Its giving me a real cynical view on being a lawyer, thats for sure.--  Best regards,  bitbitch                          mailto:bitbitch@magnesium.net ",0,"Dear Sir/Madam,

I wanted to bring to your attention a recent development that I find quite amusing. News.com has published two articles on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and, in doing so, linked to decss.exe, a piece of code that was previously deemed too controversial. As a result, 2600 was banned, while other news services that originally linked to the code were not penalized. Slashdot, naturally, has picked up on this story and linked to News.com's articles.

I find this situation quite telling. It highlights the need for Congress and the courts to re-examine how laws like the DMCA are enforced. Unfortunately, it appears that these laws are often applied arbitrarily, relying on factors such as who you know, the perceived guilt of the defendant, and the level of attention given by the presiding judge. This has left me feeling disillusioned with the legal profession.

The two rules on either side perform quite well.&gt;&gt; And here are the rules that seem like they should be better or should &gt;&gt; be recoverable:&gt;&gt;&gt;   FROM_MISSING &gt;&gt;&gt;   GAPPY_TEXT &gt;&gt;&gt;   INVALID_MSGID &gt;&gt;&gt;   MIME_NULL_BLOCK &gt;&gt;&gt;   SUBJ_MISSING&gt; well, I don&#x27;t like SUBJ_MISSING, I reckon there&#x27;s a world of mails from &gt; cron jobs (e.g.) which hit it.Okay, drop SUBJ_MISSING.&gt; But, yes, the others for sure should be recoverable, and I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s &gt; more.Probably a few, those seemed like the best prospects to me.&gt; BTW do you agree with the proposed methodology (ie. remove the rules and &gt; bugzilla each one?)I only want a bugzilla ticket for each one if people are okay with quick WONTFIX closes on the ones deemed unworthy of recovery.If you could put the stats for each rule in the ticket somehow (should be automatable with email at the very least), it would help.Dan ",0,"I propose that instead of removing the specific rules, we comment out the lowest-scoring rules in the range. This would allow us to preserve the other entries while minimizing the impact of the ""noisy"" rules. However, before we proceed, I think we should investigate the low score for DATE_IN_PAST_48_96 to ensure it's not a false negative.

I agree that the rules FROM_MISSING, GAPPY_TEXT, INVALID_MSGID, MIME_NULL_BLOCK, and SUBJ_MISSING appear to be recoverable. It's likely that there are more rules that could be improved.

Regarding the proposed methodology, I suggest only creating a Bugzilla ticket for each rule if the community is comfortable with quickly closing WONTFIX tickets. Additionally, it would be helpful to include the statistics for each rule in the ticket, which could be automated using email.

What do you think? Should we proceed with commenting out the lowest-scoring rules and investigating the DATE_IN_PAST_48_96 score before making any changes?"

Mr. Pressler, who took over the reins in 2003, is often credited with making several changes to the park, including cutting expenses, introducing new attractions, and revamping the California Adventure area. While some of these changes have been met with criticism, Mr. Pressler's efforts aimed to improve the overall park experience. 

On the other hand, James Rasulo, who previously served as the head of Euro Disney, is set to take the helm at Walt Disney Parks. Mr. Rasulo's experience in managing a European theme park will undoubtedly bring a fresh perspective to the role.

Dear Reconsideration Committee,

I'm writing to bring to your attention an urgent update regarding our sourdough quarters' astringent subsides. As you may be aware, our company has been struggling financially, and this update is crucial to our decision-making process.

Melanie, our team lead, has kindly offered her assistance in re-evaluating our bungalow supplements. However, our current situation has led us to reconsider our options. Due to the company's recent bankruptcy, we're left with no choice but to explore alternative solutions.

Reinhard, our accountant, has suggested reducing our popularization efforts to ensure a more stable financial foundation. He believes this will allow us to reallocate our resources more effectively. Alexis, our marketing expert, agrees that this approach is necessary to ensure our company's survival.

I would like to propose that we hold an emergency meeting to discuss this matter further. Please let me know if this is feasible, and I will schedule a time that suits everyone.

Dear All,

I'm pleased to share my experience with an interesting South Bay Hi-Def party at my apartment in Sunnyvale on the Fourth of July. Unfortunately, it seems that the initial invitation I sent on June 30 was delayed and only delivered on July 9. Our mailman filters captured and quarantined two posts, including the invitation.

Despite my efforts to recalibrate my self-esteem, the event attendance was, shall we say, less than expected. As a humorous aside, I almost had as much alcohol on hand as George Washington did at his election celebration, which was a public festival day.

One attendee jokingly referred to the delayed invitation as a prize, and others reacted with frustration and disappointment. However, I'd like to remind everyone that the delay was not their fault, and we all must learn to be patient.

To share a lesson I learned from this experience, I must admit that SpamAssassin rated my original invitation as spam. It seems that using certain keywords, such as ""boob tube,"" can trigger annoyance in the Great American Shrine's filters. 

In conclusion, I hope we can all learn from my mistakes and appreciate the importance of timely communication. I look forward to seeing you at future events.

Best regards,

I'm looking for a command to insert my signature using a combination of keys instead of having to insert it manually before sending the email. One possible solution is to use component files in my mail component (nmh) to store my signature. This way, when editing a message, my signature is readily available. Additionally, using component files for specific folders, I can customize my signature for each folder. The nmh documentation provides more information on this.

It's also possible to use sedit to accomplish this, but I've been using gvim as my exmh message editor for a long time. I've set up a command to load email-specific settings, such as syntax highlighting for headers and quoted parts. I could potentially map some vim keys to add my signature or even provide a selection of signatures to choose from.

There are various ways to have randomly chosen signatures, and a good resource for this is the rtfm.mit.edu website, which has a FAQ on signature fingers (from May 1995).

Hope this helps."

It seems that there is more activity on this list than on the talk and devel lists combined.

I am concerned that some users may not be aware that they should only report false negatives on this list. Either SA is missing many spam messages or some people are intentionally sending all their spam to this list. I have recently submitted some spam emails that did not score highly, with scores below 5. I assume that most users run SA with a threshold of 5, and therefore, a rule needs to be developed to catch these messages.

I would appreciate it if others could confirm if my suspicions are correct and help refine the rules to catch these spam emails."

I'm writing to you from the SAS lounge in Copenhagen, waiting for my next flight. I took a shower and changed for the journey, but I'm feeling quite warm despite the air-conditioned lounge. It's a relief to be refreshed, especially after the Timbers' victory last night! Their strong performance should secure them a spot in the playoffs.

Unfortunately, I'm without a phone at the moment, as AT&T failed to deliver it to my destination. As a result, I'll be reliant on the SAS lounge's computers to get in touch. If you need to reach me urgently, please send an email to wjwjr99@yahoo.com, which I'll check before departing again. I'd appreciate it if you could also include my Yahoo! address in case you need to contact me in the future.

As a reminder, I'll be checking in before my next flight, so I might not be able to respond immediately. I also wanted to wish you a happy birthday, and I hope you can take some time to relax and celebrate without worrying about our work.

Take care, and I look forward to connecting with you soon."
"&gt; &gt; If you&#x27;re using a break or similar construct in a while loop  &gt; then you might  &gt; &gt; want to rethink your guard condition. &gt;  &gt; Good point, I didn&#x27;t think of that. However, that doesn&#x27;t help with a &gt; case statement, which IMHO is cleaner than using an if statement if you &gt; have a lot of branches... but then again maybe that should be refactored &gt; away with polymorphism :)Well, you should consider &#x27;break&#x27; inside a &#x27;select&#x27; statement to be part of the syntax, rather than a control flow modifier.A _mandatory_ part of the syntax, at that.Later, Kenn --  Irish Linux Users&#x27; Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information. List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie ",0,"I understand your point about reconsidering guard conditions in while loops. However, I'd like to discuss the context around case statements. You mentioned that they can be cleaner than if statements, especially when dealing with multiple branches. I agree that case statements can be a good option in certain situations.

However, I'd like to challenge the idea that case statements are inherently cleaner. In fact, they can be more difficult to maintain and debug than if statements. This is because case statements can lead to a proliferation of code that becomes hard to follow.

Regarding the use of break inside a select statement, I agree that it's an essential part of the syntax. It's a control flow construct that allows us to exit the loop early, which can be useful in certain situations.

Overall, I think it's important to consider the specific use case and requirements before choosing between if statements and case statements. It's also important to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of each approach.

Thank you for your input, and I look forward to continuing this discussion.

You make a valid point that it's concerning that they might not be doing their job if they're not current with technology, which is a crucial aspect of their position. 

As someone with extensive experience in bridging the gap between tech enthusiasts and leaders, I understand how challenging it can be to make complex technology seem accessible. I believe that this hurdle is, in part, due to the fact that I've successfully presented complex ideas in a simple and easy-to-understand manner. This, in turn, might be why some individuals, including yourself, have questioned the simplicity of what I do. 

You share a relevant quote from Pablo Picasso, stating that ""Computers are useless. They can only give you answers."" This quote highlights the limited capabilities of technology, which is a valuable insight.

It seems that someone has accessed my computer and is monitoring my activity, making me feel like I am being watched and controlled.

I am also concerned about the content of the CD. It is banned in the year 2004 and I am being told to disappear in my city. This makes me feel uneasy and uncomfortable. I am worried about my safety and well-being, and I am seeking your help in resolving this situation.

I have been trying to access the website www.8005hosting.com/cd/grail, but it seems that the link is not working. I am hoping that you can help me find a solution to this problem.

I'm reaching out to inquire about any available resources on the Nyankore language, specifically regarding its grammar, lexicon, and other linguistic data. As a researcher at the Australian National University, I'm interested in learning more about this Bantu language spoken in southern Uganda.

I would greatly appreciate any assistance or guidance you can offer in this matter. Please feel free to share any relevant resources or insights you may have.

I'd like to share some exciting news about the latest developments in memory technology. The integration of Rambus memory and a fast bus seems to be giving a significant boost to Intel's newest P4 processor. According to reports, we can expect a performance increase of 3-5% with the new PC1066 memory.

While this news may seem like a game-changer, it's essential to consider the cost-benefit analysis. The new memory comes at a significantly higher price point - about 4 times more expensive than its predecessor. Nevertheless, the potential 5% speedup could make it an attractive option for those looking to upgrade.

In related news, there have been reports of a new GeForce 4600 graphics card, boasting a 20% faster performance than its predecessor. However, this comes at a double-edged cost, as it's significantly more expensive than the 4200.

It's crucial to remain cautious when considering these new developments, as they may seem too good to be true. It's essential to weigh the benefits against the increased cost. As Adam L. ""Duncan"" Beberg, a developer, has pointed out, there are concerns about the scalability and potential drawbacks of these new technologies. For instance, the PS"

"subcategorization in tranformational grammar dear colleagues , i &#x27; m wondering if someone could give me some pointers to the latest literature in transformational grammar ( gb , p&amp;p , minimalism ) that deals with issues of subcategorization . in particular i would like to get a sense of the latest thinking , including ways in which minimalism departs from previous assumptions . among the questions that i would ideally like to see addressed are the following : - what kind of subcategorization relations have been assumed in the recent literature , and for what kinds of phenomena ? for instance , a transitive verb must somehow encode the requirement of taking a dp complement . but can a verb also take a pp complement according to the identity of that pp &#x27;s head ( as in _ rely _ + _ on _ ) ? - how are subcategorization relations constrained ? that is , what syntactic ( or semantic ) properties are thought to be accessible ( in the limit ) to the selecting head ? - if there are substantive formal constraints on subcategorization , where do they come from ? is there anything in the architecture of the theory from which such constraints would follow ? thanks very much , - - andreas kathol",0,"Dear colleagues,

I'm seeking guidance on the latest research in Transformational Grammar (TG), specifically in the areas of GB, P&P, and Minimalism, as it relates to subcategorization. I'd appreciate insights into how Minimalism differs from previous assumptions.

My primary concerns revolve around the nature of subcategorization relations and the types of phenomena they describe. For instance, transitive verbs seem to require a DP complement, but can a verb also accept a PP complement based on the head noun of the PP, as seen in examples like ""rely on""?

Furthermore, I'm interested in understanding the constraints on subcategorization relations. Which syntactic or semantic properties are thought to be accessible to the selecting head, and how do these constraints arise? Are there formal architectural constraints in the theory that dictate these constraints?

Your input on these questions would be greatly appreciated. Please feel free to share your thoughts and references.

I'd like to bring to your attention a recent review article published in the Journal of NIH Research (Vol 7, No. 1, January 1995, pp. 50-55). The article, titled ""Climbing the Family Tree: What Makes a Hominid a Hominid?"", discusses the linguistic abilities of Kanzi, an ape studied by Sue Savage-Rumbaugh and her colleagues.

In the article, the author, Pat Shipman, summarizes the work of Savage-Rumbaugh, who claims that Kanzi possesses a rudimentary grammar and can use displaced referents and arbitrary symbols, much like a 2-year-old child. Shipman also discusses the work of Derek Bickerton, who admits that Kanzi, along with other apes and young children, uses ""proto-language"" but not full language due to the lack of grammatical elements.

Additionally, I'd like to emphasize the difference between our approach to python.org/zope.org mailing list traffic and other lists. While we are more liberal in our handling of traffic, it's essential to maintain a distinction between public and personal emails.

Please let me know if you agree with this proposal, and we can discuss further implementation details. -GW"
"I&#x27;m sure that The Beatles are weel happy with Microserfs for robbing them blind of their &quot;intellectual Property&quot;I&#x27;m gonna mail complaints@microsoft.com and get them to put an end to these windows cd&#x27;s ;--)Don&#x27;t suppose you have a reference for it? I&#x27;ve made a lot of friends in the MS complaints department, its amazing what you can say to them and get away with it --::)))CWAnd no sorry I don&#x27;t know the solution, they must be pretty bad quality though if you can fit 25 albums on one CD. I would say they are Mpeg encoded or some buzz like that. --------------------- I&#x27;ve got some really interesting wav files here.A friend had a Windows CD with, wait for it . . .Every Beatles Record ever released in the U.K.! Including the Christmas and  BBC special albums! All on one, ordinary CD! Yes a 650M CD!Of course this CD also had a special Windows app for playing this collection!I had a look at the contents of the CD, since I don&#x27;t do Windows, and the  albums appeared to be plain wav files? Each album in it&#x27;s own wav file, 25  Albums, 25 wav files?!? I copied the wav files to my hard drive. Curious thing, though, noatun crashes on some of the larger ones, seems to  attempt to load the entire file into memory first, and on the ones it doesn&#x27;t  crash on, it plays them fast and noisily? kwave refuses to recognise them  completely and wavp just makes an ungodly noise!xanim can, and does play them correctly though. Unfortunately xanim does nothave any position control so you just have to listen to the album from startto finish.file has this to say about them:johngay@debian:/home/jgay$ file beatles/SGT.WAV beatles/SGT.WAV: RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio, Microsoft ADPCM,  stereo 22050 Hz johngay@debian:/home/jgay$ ls -l beatles/SGT.WAV -r-xr-xr-x    1 johngay  johngay  53334900 Sep 27  2001 beatles/SGT.WAVAnd this is SGT Pepper&#x27;s lonely Hearts Club Band album. 51M is quite good,  considering it also has the inner track. But they certainly are NOT in stereo.What I would like to do is split up the tracks and convert them the mp3 for  xmms. I&#x27;m jsut not sure what tools would be able to handle these strange  compressed wav&#x27;s that only xanim seems to recognise? I like the albums, but  would prefer to be able to sellect tracks to play rather than entire albums  and be able to listen to all my music with one app. I know xmms has a WAV  plugin, but it does not recognise these either.Any help will be greatly appreciated!Cheers, John Gay --  Irish Linux Users&#x27; Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

Dear John,

I'd like to help you with your query about the strange compressed WAV files you've encountered on the Windows CD containing Beatles music. As you've discovered, these files are encoded in a way that's not compatible with most standard media players, including XMMS.

After conducting some research, I found that the files are likely encoded using Microsoft's ADPCM compression algorithm, which is a proprietary format. This might explain why some players, like Notun, crash when trying to play these files, and others, like Kwave, refuse to recognize them altogether.

Regarding your wish to split the tracks and convert them to MP3 for playback with XMMS, I recommend using a tool like Sox (Sound eXchange), which is a free, open-source audio file conversion tool. Sox can convert WAV files to MP3 and other formats. You can use Sox to split the tracks and convert them to MP3, making them compatible with XMMS.

Another option would be to use a tool like FFmpeg, which is a powerful, open-source multimedia processing tool. FFmpeg can convert WAV files to MP3, as well as perform other audio processing tasks.

Before using either of these tools, I recommend that you check the licenses and terms of use for"
