We've discontinued the use of Outlook in our workplace due to the numerous vulnerabilities and exploits that it poses to our corporate network and data. Our concern is that even a single exploited system can put our entire network, customer systems, company reputation, and proprietary data at risk. Moreover, we can't rely on users to use Outlook in a safe manner, making it a liability from an employer's perspective.

Regarding custom sequences files, I'm not familiar with their use. It seems that custom sequences can help maintain indices, but I'm not sure how to make indices with them or keep them up to date. Perhaps a cron job could be used to maintain the sequences.

One feature that we miss in Outlook is support for S/MIME. We're currently running exmh on a remote machine, which has weak mime handling due to the lack of support for S/MIME.

In essence, the article reports on the Peruvian government's efforts to reduce its software costs by adopting open source alternatives. The initiative is part of a broader effort to increase transparency and accountability in government spending.

This study examines the transcripts of these summings-up, which can vary in length from a few to hundreds of pages, and are significant in breaking the flow between advocates' turn-taking, especially their final speeches, and the deliberation of the jury. The book considers this practice as a legal problem, unrecognized advocacy, and examines alternative models, such as those in the US, Canada, and Scotland. In particular, the Scottish model is recommended for consideration by Anglo-Welsh judges, with its emphasis on parsimonious reference to the disputed narrative, only where relevant to the legal issues on which instruction is being given."

Unless I'm mistaken, it's possible to perceive this difference in certain cases. For instance, Polish has a contrast between initial clusters and affricates, where words like ""trzy"" and ""czy"" differ only in the presence of a cluster versus an affricate.

Moreover, when comparing the English pronunciation of ""ts"" with the German pronunciation of ""z"" (or Polish, Yiddish, etc.), there's a noticeable difference. English speakers may render ""matzah"" (or ""matzoh"") with a different sound than Yiddish or Polish speakers. Interestingly, I've found a few English speakers who pronounce ""matzah"" with an affricate, /ts/, in some Yiddish borrowings, but not in others, which affects their rhyming abilities. Additionally, some speakers may have a one-segment /ts/ in phrases like ""hit ya"" but a two-segment /t/+/s/ in ""hits ya""."

Dear All,

I am writing to inform you that we experienced an outage on EnronOnline on August 9, 2001, which resulted in slow message delivery and trading suspensions. The issue was caused by a bug in the firmware on a single disk in our storage system, which responded slowly but did not fail over as expected.

At 8:40 am, we started noticing delivery slowdowns, and by 8:50 am, updates were so slow that we had to suspend all trading products. We brought the site offline at 8:56 am to prevent any further issues. By 9:10 am, we isolated the problem to a single disk and removed it from the configuration, bringing the database back online by 9:28 am.

During the time the site was down, we experienced issues with another brick of storage, which we had to take offline again at 11:17 am. After verifying that there was no data corruption or loss, we brought the site back online by 11:56 am.

I want to assure you that we have already received a patch from the disk vendor and will be applying it to all our storage systems, one brick at a time, starting tonight.

"&gt; I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by &quot;let&#x27;s you and him fight&quot;, but it is  &gt; important to remember that England was in control of Ireland &gt; for 300 years ...Exactly -- &quot;let&#x27;s you and him fight&quot; is a way of dealing with troublesome populations by moving them next to one another, so they give each other, and not the Man, grief*.So by my understanding (and, you all will understand, with tongue firmly in cheek):Ireland:  Irish?  Uppity barbarians overly    fond of &quot;risings&quot;.  Scots?  More uppity    barbarians overly fond of &quot;risings&quot;.    Why not plonk down a bunch of the latter    next to the former and kill two birds    with one stone?Israel:  Ex-ottomans?  Uppity barbarians    (didn&#x27;t they help kick out the Ottomans?)    Zionists?  Uppity sorts who aren&#x27;t happy    with perfectly good land in Uganda.  Why    not plonk down a bunch of the latter next    to the former and kill two birds with one    stone?but not:India: in which the muslims and hindus were     originally intermixed to some degree,     but Partioned due to their own conflict,     not due to English resettlement policy.Canada: in which the french and english were     already established, and it was just the     balance of power on the continent that     determined events in the colonies.  The     Acadians got resettled, but they don&#x27;t     seem to have been that good for picking     fights with their neighbors, so no one     had them plonked down next door.-Dave* this works best with a populace who, given &quot;one man, one vote&quot;, immediately deduce &quot;one less man, one less vote&quot; -- eh, Magnan? ",0,"
I'd like to reiterate the importance of considering historical context when discussing complex issues. The phrase ""let's you and him fight"" is a metaphorical way to describe a strategy for managing troublesome populations by relocating them to a shared area, with the intention of minimizing conflicts with the dominant group.

In the context of Ireland, this means relocating Scots, who are seen as barbaric and prone to uprisings, alongside the Irish, also known as ""uppity barbarians"" with a penchant for ""risings."" This approach would allow for the troubles to be managed more effectively.

In contrast, Israel is an example of ex-Ottomans and Zionists, both considered ""uppity barbarians,"" being relocated together. This approach would also allow for the troubles to be managed more effectively.

On the other hand, India is a unique case, where the partitioning of Muslims and Hindus was a result of their own conflicts, rather than English resettlement policy. Similarly, in Canada, the French and English had already established themselves, and it was the balance of power on the continent that determined the events in the colonies.

It's essential to acknowledge the complexities of historical events and avoid simplistic solutions. Instead, we should strive to understand the nuances and"

As a token of my appreciation, I would like to share one of my favorite palindromes: ""nie fragt sie: ist gefegt? sie ist gar fein"" (source unknown). It translates to ""She never asks: has the sweeping been done? She is very refined.""

I'd like to agree with Tom Craven's astute observation. It's intriguing to consider why the phrase ""could've"" expands to ""could of"" with emphasis on the second element, pronounced like ""of"" rather than ""have."" I wonder if the model of ""to"" is relevant here. Notice that ""to"" behaves like a preposition when used before a noun, but verb-like when used before an infinitive, as in ""it's important never to tell lies."" Additionally, ""to"" has two forms, weak and strong. Interestingly, you never find ""of"" used after a tensed verb, except in cases where it's used after modals, just like ""of"" in ""could of."" I'd like to point out that the ""of"" in ""could of"" cannot be the preposition ""of"" because the latter requires a complement, whereas the ""of"" after ""could of"" can be elided, as in ""I could of."""

"URL: http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/09/25#medicalNotes Date: Wed, 25 Sep 2002 12:49:48 GMTMixed news from yesterday&#x27;s heart checkup. First, I went seven minutes on the treadmill. That was pretty good. My heart  was racing like it hadn&#x27;t since I was in college. They also did an extensive  ultrasound on my carotid arteries[1], they&#x27;re in the neck and supply my head  with blood. More good news there. They&#x27;re clear, free of plaque, healthy, not  diseased[2]. So it appears I just have coronary artery disease, not general  artery disease. That&#x27;s good because there would be a risk of stroke if they  were sick, and not a whole lot they can do about it (as they can with the  heart). Now there was some not-good news. A small part of my heart isn&#x27;t working very  well. There are a few possible reasons for that, some fixable, some not. I  asked the doctor, does this mean I&#x27;m going to die sooner, and he said no. Does  it mean I have to restrict what I do, he said no. So what does it mean? Really  not much, other than I should watch, as before, for recurring symptoms, the  ones that brought me into the hospital in June. If they come back, we&#x27;ll do an  angiogram, and maybe an angioplasty, but the likelihood of another bypass  because of this is small. That&#x27;s quite a relief. I don&#x27;t like the idea of part  of my heart not working, but what can you do about it?[1] http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;safe=off&amp;q=carotid+arteries&amp;spell=1 [2] http://www.vascularweb.org/doc/190 ",0,"I recently attended a heart checkup and received mixed news. The treadmill test revealed that I was able to walk for seven minutes without any issues, which is a positive sign. Additionally, the ultrasound exam on my carotid arteries showed that they are clear and healthy, free of any plaque or disease.

However, the doctor also detected some problems with my heart. A portion of it is not functioning properly, and there are several reasons why this might be the case. Fortunately, the doctor assured me that this does not mean I will die sooner or that I need to significantly restrict my activities. Instead, I should continue to monitor my health and report any recurring symptoms. If necessary, we may perform an angiogram and possibly an angioplasty to address the issue. The good news is that the likelihood of needing another bypass surgery is relatively low.

Overall, I am relieved to hear that my condition is manageable, but I do need to remain vigilant and watch for any signs of recurring symptoms. The doctor's reassurances have given me a sense of peace, and I am hopeful that I can continue to live a healthy and active life."

It is our pleasure to bring to your attention a public notice regarding an exciting business opportunity in the immune support industry. As a bestseller in The New York Times, Robert Kiyosaki's book ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"" highlights the importance of creating wealth by going into business for yourself.

In the book, Kiyosaki emphasizes that the only way to achieve true wealth is by creating a business that distributes products rather than manufacturing them. The health and wellness industry is expected to reach a staggering trillion-dollar mark by 2010, as predicted by leading economist Paul Zane Pilzer and Professor Dr. Charles King, a renowned expert in marketing.

We are offering an accredited course taught by Tim Sales, a successful entrepreneur earning over $25 million annually from his business in 24 countries. The course focuses on recognizing a professional business model and highlights the importance of four key principles: a huge expanding market, unique consumable products, timing/trends, and employing others.

Our company meets all four of these essential principles, and we invite you to learn more about this exciting opportunity. To do so, simply email us at care4family@excite.com, providing your name, phone number, and best time to reach you. If you have any questions"

"jm@jmason.org (Justin Mason) writes:&gt; Folks who&#x27;ve been hacking on the DNSBLs: would it be worthwhile commenting &gt; this in HEAD, seeing as it only gets .77 anyway? &gt;  &gt; Sounds like the (a) broken server and (b) low hitrate combine to make it &gt; not-so-useful IMO.No, in my opinion, it&#x27;s purely a bug in SA (or the libraries we use, which is the same thing) that we don&#x27;t handle outages of network services better.The rule is useful and it does help reduce spam, we should keep it.  I have a feeling the DNSBL rules will cluster a bit more heavily around the 1.0 to 2.0 range once we start using the new GA on them.Also, 0.77 was a slightly conservative number.  Since I didn&#x27;t have real-time data, I typically used the lower or median number of different periods (most recent month, two months, six months), depending on the trend of the period data (better performance for recent messages -&gt; favor recent scores, worse performance for recent messages -&gt; favor lowest scores, never pick the highest number unless the rule was very accurate and the highest number was for the most recent data).Dan ",0,"I believe it would be valuable to keep the DNSBL rule, even though it only achieves a hit rate of 0.77. The rule is still useful in reducing spam and should not be removed. Instead, we should focus on improving our handling of network service outages in SpamAssassin (or the libraries we use).

While it may be tempting to eliminate the rule due to its relatively low effectiveness, I think it's essential to recognize that the broken server and low hit rate are contributing factors, rather than the rule itself being ineffective. In my opinion, it's crucial to prioritize keeping the rule and continue to fine-tune it to optimize its performance.

I also want to note that the 0.77 hit rate is likely a conservative estimate. When analyzing trend data, I often use a combination of recent and historical data to determine the most accurate score. Given the current statistics, I predict that DNSBL rules will cluster more heavily around the 1.0 to 2.0 range once we implement the new GA.

Let's keep the rule and continue to work on enhancing our network service outage handling."

I am writing to express my concerns regarding your recent article on warchalking, which I believe portrayed an inaccurate representation of the issue. In your piece, you seemed to suggest that warchalking is primarily about stealing access from open, but not shared APs. However, I have found that the majority of stories on the topic that relate to this issue are actually sourced from law enforcement reports, which do not provide specific locations, arrests, or photographs of the offending marks.

I understand that warchalking can be a legitimate concern, but I believe it is essential to approach this topic with a balanced perspective. Your article failed to provide sufficient context and nuance, leading to an oversimplification of the issue. I would appreciate it if you could provide a more comprehensive understanding of warchalking in your future articles.

Sincerely,
Glenn Fleishman"

Dear colleagues, I am pleased to share with you two recent publications in the field of logic, language, and information. The first book is ""Studies in Logic, Language and Information: Learnable Classes of Categorial Grammars"" by Makoto Kanazawa from Chiba University in Japan. This work explores the learnability of various classes of classical categorial grammars within the Gold paradigm of identification in the limit from positive data. The author demonstrates that the class of K-valued grammars for K=1, 2, 3,..., is learnable both from structures and from strings, while the class of least-valued grammars and the class of least-cardinality grammars are learnable from structures.

In proving these learnable results, the author crucially uses a theorem on the concept of finite elasticity. The learning algorithms used in this work build on Buszkowski and Penn's algorithms for finding categorial grammars from input consisting of functor-argument structures.

The second publication is ""The Tbilisi Symposium on Logic, Language and Computation: Selected Papers"" edited by Jonathan Ginzburg from Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Zurab Khasidashvili from NTT Basic Research Labs in Japan, Carl Vogel from University"

However, using one omnidirectional antenna and one directional antenna in the dual antenna mounts may not be the most effective setup.

This is because the omnidirectional antenna is designed to receive signals from all directions, which can lead to interference and reduced signal strength. In contrast, a directional antenna is optimized for receiving signals from a specific direction, which can help reduce interference and increase signal strength.

By combining the two, you may end up with a signal that's not optimized for any particular direction, which can reduce the overall signal quality. A diversity antenna, on the other hand, is designed to switch between multiple antennas to maximize the signal strength and quality.

If you want to take advantage of the directional antenna's benefits, it's recommended to use a directional antenna for both receivers and transmitters, or to use a directional antenna in combination with a diversity antenna. This can help improve the signal quality and range."

I appreciate your proposal and the confidence you have in me. However, I must express my reservations about the entire situation. The proposal seems too good to be true, and I am concerned about the potential risks involved. Furthermore, I am unsure about the legitimacy of the abandoned funds and the claims being made about them.

Despite my reservations, I am willing to explore the possibility of collaborating with you. However, I must stress that I will need to conduct my own due diligence and research before committing to any course of action. I also expect transparency and clarity throughout the process, including the ownership and legitimacy of the funds.

Please provide me with more information about the late account owner and the bank's procedures for transferring the funds. I would also like to know more about the risks involved and the potential consequences of not pursuing this opportunity.

I appreciate your understanding and look forward to hearing back from you.

Earlier this year, the RIAA announced its new plan to access computers without owner&#x27;s consent for the sake of protecting its assets. Information Wave believes this policy puts its customers at risk of unintentional damage, corporate espionage, and invasion of privacy to say the least.Due to the nature of this matter and RIAA&#x27;s previous history, we feel the RIAA will abuse software vulnerabilities in a client&#x27;s browser after the browser accesses its site, potentially allowing the RIAA to access and/or tamper with your data. Starting at midnight on August 19, 2002, Information Wave customers will no longer be able to reach the RIAA&#x27;s web site. Information Wave will also actively seek out attempts by the RIAA to thwart this policy and apply additional filters to protect our customers&#x27; data.Information Wave will also deploy peer-to-peer clients on the Gnutella network from its security research and development network (honeynet) which will offer files with popular song titles derived from the Billboard Top 100 maintained by VNU eMedia. No copyright violations will take place, these files will merely have arbitrary sizes similar to the length of a 3 to 4 minute MP3 audio file encoded at 128kbps. Clients which connect to our peer-to-peer clients, and then afterwards attempt to illegally access the network will be immediately blacklisted from Information Wave&#x27;s network. The data collected will be actively maintained and distributed from our network operations site.The placement of this policy is not intended to hamper the RIAA&#x27;s piracy elimination agenda or advocate Internet piracy, but to ensure the safety of our customers&#x27; data attached to our network from hackers or corporate espionage hidden by the veil of RIAA copyright enforcement.If you have questions, comments, or concerns regarding this policy, please e-mail riaa@informationwave.net. --  ----------------- R.

A Forest Service official has stated that the tree lovers' lawsuits have hindered efforts to address the issue by preventing the removal of dense tree stands and undergrowth. This, in turn, has led to an accumulation of flammable material, resulting in crown fires like the Cerro Grande fire.

It's essential to understand that these forest fires are not solely the result of Forest Service policies. The official acknowledged that the agency's ""10:00 A.M. policy"" has been a major factor in the buildup of vegetation over the years.

By preventing the implementation of projects aimed at clearing out dense forests, tree lover lawsuits are actually contributing to the problem they are trying to solve. This is a critical issue that needs to be addressed to prevent future devastating fires.

I'd like to emphasize that the Forest Service is not just a passive observer in this scenario. The agency has been hindered in its efforts to manage the forests effectively due to the lawsuits. It's crucial to find a balance between protecting the environment and ensuring public safety."

I recently had to wipe Linux from my PC, but forgot to restore the original MBR (NT). Is there a way to do this without installing another operating system? I've tried formatting the entire disk, but that didn't work.

The easy solution is to install another operating system, as it should overwrite the MBR. However, this might not be the desired outcome, as Microsoft's installers often overwrite the MBR without asking for permission.

If you need to restore the MBR without installing another OS, you can try using a bootable floppy disk with a Linux-based MBR restoration tool. These tools are available online and can help you recover your original MBR.

Alternatively, you can try using a Windows-based tool to restore the MBR. Microsoft's recovery console or a third-party tool like Easy Recovery can help you achieve this.

I hope this helps. If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask."

( 1 ) you had n&#x27;t better stay here tonight . ( 2 ) you had not better stay here tonight . ( 3 ) a : i promise i &#x27; ll pay you back . b : you better had . to my surprise , soon after my posting , i got as many as 64 reposes . thank you very much for answering my query . i had n&#x27;t expected so may people were interested on this matter . i think i should mention all the names and e-mail addresses , but there are far too many to mention . if you feel this is inadequet , please email to prof . tanaka to write your names on the list . i will immediately prepare for writing your names . the result of the inquiry is as follows : ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ok 10 0 12 ? 15 5 3 * 39 59 49 about two thirds of the respondents refused these usages and i can also add that these usages varies geometrically , especially british english , it seemed to me . i also asked for a few sentences using _ it ( or this ) had better . . . examples ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) below are typical instances of _ had better _ with inanimate subjects : ( 4 ) it had better not rain tomorrow or we can&#x27;t got to the beach .

( 6 ) joe : i can explain why i am late . jane : this had better be good some people say that _ this had better be good _ is a cliche and in ( 6 ) it implies the speaker kas expectations that the excuse will be fanciful or just plain untrue . i would like to thank again to all the people who reponded . if you had any comments on this matter , please email through prof . tanaka to me . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * best wishes , hiroaki tanaka , associate professor , tokushima university , japan hiro-t @ ias . tokushima-u . ac . jp",0,"
I am writing to you on behalf of my friend, who asked me to verify the acceptability of certain sentences that use the construction ""had better"" with a subject. The sentences in question are: ""You had better not stay here tonight,"" ""You had not better stay here tonight,"" and ""You better had.""

The initial inquiry raised several points, including the acceptability of sentences with an inanimate subject, such as ""It had better not rain tomorrow or we can't go to the beach."" A summary of the results is presented below.

The results show that approximately two-thirds of the respondents rejected the usage of ""had better"" with an inanimate subject, and that this usage varies geometrically, especially in British English.

The examples provided in the email include sentences (4), (5), and (6), which demonstrate the use of ""had better"" with inanimate subjects. Sentence (6) in particular uses the phrase ""This had better be good"" to convey a sense of expectation or skepticism.

We would like to thank all those who responded to this inquiry for their input. If anyone has any further comments, please feel free to email them through Professor Tanaka to me.

Hiroaki Tanaka, Associate Professor, Tok"

NObody compells them to stand there, I&#x27;ll agree fully. &gt; But we still have a Constitutional right to speak out against &gt; policies, actions and grievances. &gt; &gt; Again.  If you want it another way, lets change the Constitution.Huh?  Are you saying that whoever has the loudest voice gets to be heard? Shouting down a public speaker could be considered a form of censorship. If shouting down public speakers is &#x27;protected&#x27; it is only a matter of time before the people doing the shouting have their tactic used against them -every single time they open their mouth-. The tactic is stupid and non-productive and if generally used, will only result in chaos.  The tactic is just stupid ego-bation at best, unless the goal is to generate chaos. And humans whose goals and actions in life are to create chaos in society should be locked up (provided you can accurately identify them, which is not really possible anyway, but hey, this is my rant :-). IMHO.Bill ",0,"As I see it, free speech is not a guarantee that we can shout down or interrupt others in their daily lives, especially when they are not interested in engaging with us. While we have the right to express ourselves against policies, actions, and grievances, we must do so in a respectful manner that does not infringe upon others' freedom. The example of shouting down public speakers is a clear violation of this principle. It is not only a form of censorship, but also a selfish and chaotic way of silencing others, which can only lead to more chaos and division. I believe that we must find alternative ways to express ourselves and engage with others, rather than resorting to loud and aggressive tactics. If we truly want to be heard, we must be willing to listen and engage with others in a respectful and constructive manner. Let's work together to promote civil and respectful dialogue, rather than seeking to dominate or intimidate others."

I have found that the 7.3 binary should work as long as you install the ""rpm404"" compatibility library. However, I have experienced some issues with rpm 4.1 versions that sometimes hang during operations (-e, -i, -F, or -U) and the only workaround is to kill the process and remove the ""/var/lib/rpm/__*"" files before trying again.

It seems that this issue can occur frequently, and after killing the process with a -9 signal, the rpm command becomes unusable until the machine is restarted. Fortunately, removing the ""/var/lib/rpm/__*"" files and trying again resolves the issue 100% of the time for me.

I would like to know if you have tried this workaround and if it has been successful for you.

Firstly, I am happy to inform you that Chapter 3 has been approved for publication. Regarding the author bio, I would recommend leaving it unchanged, as it reflects the author's employment status at the time of contributing to the chapter. I understand that the author, Grant, has since left the company, but I believe it would be inappropriate to update the bio and advertise his new employer.

Regarding the ad material, I have reviewed it and found it to be suitable for publication. I have attached the necessary documents for your reference.

Please let me know if you require any further assistance or have any questions.

We are excited to announce a new organizational change designed to better align our engineering and operations capabilities with the commercial businesses they support. Effective immediately, we are forming a new business unit, Enron Engineering and Operational Services (EEOS), which will combine our existing operations in Enron Engineering and Construction Company (EE&CC), Operational Energy Corporation (OEC), and National Energy Production Corporation (NEPCO).

Brian Stanley, as President and Chief Executive Officer, and Keith Dodson, as Chief Operating Officer, will lead this new organization, reporting to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services. NEPCO will continue to operate as a standalone business under John Gillis, President.

The majority of EE&CC and OEC's activities focus on assets and projects within Wholesale Services, aligning EEOS efforts with the commercial businesses it supports. EEOS will work closely with and have direct accountability to the business units it supports, centralizing our engineering and operations capabilities in a single segment.

This realignment will allow for the sharing and implementation of innovation and best practices across our operations, better identification of priorities, and more effective resource allocation. Consistent with this approach, Development Engineering will have dual reporting to both EEOS and the business units it supports.

I've reviewed the CPR pipeline exchange for the delivery periods of 10/00 to 12/00, and I couldn't find any imbalance flashing in the CPR report. The buys and sales seem to be equal, as expected. However, we've been booking an imbalance every month on the parking and lending contract. Could you please investigate if there's a missing entry in CPR for these volumes?

What compelling reasons do you see behind the notion that picture-sharing will have a profound impact on human communication?

Hello Mr. or Madam,

I believe that people are resorting to shouting and screaming over political figures because they feel that it is the only means to be heard in a noisy and chaotic environment. It's as if they're saying that, unless they can engage in a public gathering or forum, they will not be able to express their opinions or sentiments. This raises questions about the importance of free speech and the ability to express oneself without being silenced or ignored.

In an ideal scenario, individuals would have the opportunity to engage in respectful dialogue and debate, free from intimidation or coercion. However, when circumstances make it difficult or impossible to be heard, people may resort to more aggressive methods to be heard. This can lead to situations where individuals feel compelled to scream or shout in order to be heard.

It's important to recognize that free speech is not a license to engage in any behavior, regardless of the circumstances. Rather, it's a fundamental right that should be exercised responsibly and respectfully. While it's true that individuals can choose to walk away from a situation that makes them uncomfortable, it's also important to acknowledge that people have the right to express their opinions and engage in public discourse without fear of retaliation or suppression.

I understand that some may argue that this type"

Dear All,

I wanted to share an unsettling incident that occurred recently in San Francisco. Two individuals who were participating in an anti-war demonstration on Saturday critically injured themselves by sticking their heads through the roof of a former school bus as they were passing through the Broadway Tunnel. Unfortunately, both individuals died as a result of their actions.

I understand that this incident may seem tragic, but I couldn't help but find it somewhat ironic. As I was pointing out in my initial post, there is only one location in the entire city of San Francisco where individuals were advised to keep their heads inside - the Broadway Tunnel. Unfortunately, these two individuals did not heed this warning and suffered the consequences.

I must admit that I did find some humor in the situation, but I also acknowledge that this is not a laughing matter. Losing one's life is a grave tragedy, and I hope that this incident serves as a cautionary tale for others to follow safety guidelines.

Best regards,

He arrived at this conclusion based on a physical examination of the patient and various blood tests conducted at Vienna's Rudolfinerhaus clinic and elsewhere. Dr. Zimpfer suspects ""third-party involvement"" and stated that the concentration of dioxin in Yushchenko's body is ""1,000 times above the normal levels."" He believes that Yushchenko has ""a tremendous amount of dioxin in the blood, so much that it's beyond the scale."" Dr. Zimpfer has sent samples to labs in Europe and across the Atlantic Ocean for further analysis. Ukrainian authorities have reopened an investigation into Yushchenko's illness in response to Dr. Zimpfer's findings. Yushchenko has accused Ukrainian authorities of attempting to poison him ahead of the November presidential election, which was later annulled by Ukraine's supreme court.

To set the record straight, it's essential to distinguish between lasso and sabotage. While squawk and whom might seem unrelated, they are, in fact, connected. 

Catalysis, a key concept in chemistry, can be applied to the situation, where apse tries to incise and nearsightedness can lead to bellini's congress. It's crucial to have a chat about viscous debauchery, as it relates to despoiling the kilgore's savannah and woodruff's eyepiece.

I'd like to bring to your attention that the list has been dominated by discussions about apt-rpm lately. While apt-rpm is a great tool, I think it's essential to refocus on new packages and rpm building techniques. To achieve this, perhaps we could consider creating a separate list for apt-rpm-related topics, such as apt-rpm-hotline@freshrpms.net.

In the meantime, I'd like to encourage everyone to visit the apt-list on http://lists.freshrpms.net/. Although it has been up for a while, it's currently quiet due to my intention to use it primarily for apt-rpm-related matters like mirrors and building repositories. However, it could serve as a platform for general apt-rpm questions.

Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to our continued discussions.

"simultaneous prepositions and postpositions in pashto i &#x27; m looking for analyses of nominal constructions ( in any language ) in which the np has _ both _ a preposition and a postposition . for example , pashto has constructions like the following , from herbert penzl , _ a grammar of pashto _ ( washington , d . c . : american council of learned societies , 1955 ) , p . 41 : we sarri te to man to &#x27; to the man &#x27; the preposition is sometimes optional , though the postposition is obligatory . since pashto is head-final ( the unmarked word order is sov ) , it &#x27;s tempting to take the postposition at face-value . however , there are some binding facts that suggest that a phrase containing an np + postposition is referential , and so it might be possible to analyze the postposition as some kind of case marker . i understand that there may be such a distinction between homophonous case markers and postpositions in japanese , for example . i &#x27;d be grateful if anyone could suggest any articles that deal with these constructions . and if there are other linguists who are studying pashto , i &#x27;d like to hear from you . thanks for any help ! taylor roberts &lt; troberts @ mit . edu &gt;",0,"I am seeking research on nominal constructions in various languages where the noun phrase contains both a preposition and a postposition. A relevant example from Pashto grammar, as described by Herbert Penzl, is the construction ""we sarri te to man to,"" where a preposition is sometimes optional, while the postposition is obligatory. Since Pashto is a head-final language (with a typical word order of SOV), it is tempting to view the postposition as a straightforward case marker. However, there are certain binding facts that suggest a phrase with an NP and postposition is referential, which may allow us to analyze the postposition as a type of case marker. I am aware that there might be a distinction between homophonous case markers and postpositions in Japanese, for instance. I would greatly appreciate any recommendations for articles addressing these constructions. Additionally, if there are other linguists studying Pashto, I would be delighted to hear from you.

"URL: http://www.newsisfree.com/click/-3,8483155,1440/ Date: Not suppliedAirlines are facing fresh calls to fit fuel tank inerting systems, following  warnings from Boeing about potentially faulty fuel pumps ",0,"As you may be aware, Boeing has recently issued a warning regarding potentially faulty fuel pumps that could compromise the safety of airline passengers. In light of this information, there is a growing demand for airlines to install fuel tank inerting systems. 

These systems work by replacing oxygen in the fuel tanks with an inert gas, which significantly reduces the risk of explosion. While the primary concern is ensuring the safety of passengers, it's essential for airlines to take proactive measures to mitigate potential risks. 

Boeing's warning emphasizes the urgency of addressing this issue, and we believe that fitting fuel tank inerting systems is a crucial step in ensuring the well-being of both passengers and crew. We urge all airlines to take this warning seriously and prioritize the installation of these systems as soon as possible. 

Please be aware that this is not a new requirement, and many airlines have already begun the process of installing these systems. We urge all airlines to take necessary actions to ensure the safety of their passengers and maintain a level of compliance with the regulatory standards.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and we appreciate your cooperation in addressing this pressing issue."

Dear [Recipient],

I wanted to reach out to you regarding the recent correspondence we exchanged. I wanted to clarify a few points to ensure we are on the same page. Firstly, I would like to emphasize that the task at hand is not something unusual or exceptional in nature. However, I do believe that taking the necessary steps will help us achieve our goals more efficiently.

Regarding the issue with the ancillary bodies, I would like to assure you that we are taking all necessary measures to ensure their proper functioning. It is crucial that we accurately assess the situation to avoid any misjudgments.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to the recent developments in the cherry market. The recent rottenness has led to an unpleasant experience, but I believe we can find a solution by loosening our grip on the situation.

In relation to our previous discussion, I would like to clarify that the ancient practices we are considering do not necessarily require us to rehearse complicity. It is more important for us to understand the complexion of the situation and the profusion of information available.

I would appreciate your input on this matter, as it is crucial that we stay on the same page. Please feel free to reach out to me at your earliest convenience. My contact details are"

Dear friend,

I am writing to seek your assistance in a business transaction that presents an opportunity for mutual benefit. After reviewing your profile, I believe you would be the perfect candidate to help me in this matter.

As the chief accountant at a bank where a deceased individual, Mr. Gavin Norris, had a US $8.3 million account, I have been instructed by the bank's board of trustees to notify his next of kin. Unfortunately, after conducting a thorough search, we found that Mr. Norris had no known next of kin, which means that the funds will be lost to the government if we do not take action.

To prevent this from happening, myself and some trusted colleagues are seeking someone to stand as Mr. Norris's next of kin. We propose that you accept this responsibility, and in return, we will ensure a 100% risk-free transaction. You will retain 30% of the total amount, and we will use 10% to reimburse any expenses incurred during the transaction. The remaining 60% will be held until further instructions.

If this proposal sounds appealing to you, please respond to this email, and I will provide you with the necessary documents and details. If not, I understand and apologize for any offense caused.

I listened to Aaron Schwartz's interview on NPR's Weekend Edition, discussing Warchalking. While his squeaky voice was amusing, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of jealousy that he got to share his thoughts on the topic. However, I must admit that I'm having trouble understanding the hype surrounding Warchalking. I haven't come across any instances of it, and I'm curious to know if anyone else shares my skepticism. Once the link to the NPR article becomes available, I'll make sure to check it out. Perhaps some clarity on the significance of Warchalking will be provided."

According to the BBC News Scotland website, a team of archaeologists has made a remarkable discovery in the north-east of Scotland. Excavations at the Cawdor Castle have unearthed the remains of a previously unknown medieval chapel, complete with intricate stone carvings and artifacts. The finds suggest that the chapel was built in the 14th century and was in use until the 16th century.

The team, led by Dr. Elizabeth Miller, has been studying the site for over a year and has made several significant discoveries. The most notable find is a beautifully preserved stone effigy of a nobleman, believed to be the remains of Sir Alexander Sutherland, a prominent Scottish nobleman. The effigy is accompanied by a series of intricate carvings depicting scenes from everyday life in the 14th century.

The significance of this discovery cannot be overstated. It is a major breakthrough in our understanding of Scottish medieval history, providing a unique insight into the lives and culture of the period. I would recommend reading the full article to learn more about the discovery and its implications."

"URL: http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000637 Date: 2002-10-05T21:15:55-06:00I guess it&#x27;s time to reveal the incredibly kind invitation I received[1]. As  many of you may have found out or guessed, I will be attending oral argument  for the Eldred case[2] before the Supreme Court. I&#x27;m incredibly excited, as you might imagine. Visiting the Supreme Court would  be quite enough, but seeing such an important case...Dayenu! When Lessig asked  me if I was free that day to come, I laughed because I couldn&#x27;t (and still  can&#x27;t) think of anything I&#x27;d rather do than attend. I am eternally grateful to  Lessig for the chance to attend. On the other hand, I&#x27;m sort of embarassed to  have the opportunity, when there are surely others who deserve it far more than  me. Luckily, it seems that such deserving others will be able to get seats by  camping in line with us. So, I&#x27;ll be arriving in D.C. on Tuesday, attending an  Eldred/Duke/EPIC/Bookmobile superparty, and then camping in line with Seth  Schoen[3], Lisa Rein, Jace Cooke but unfortunately not Cory Doctorow. If you&#x27;d  like to come with us, let me know. I was hoping I&#x27;d be able to take notes and post them to my weblog for those who  couldn&#x27;t make it, but as I read in today&#x27;s Times, only lawyers and those with  official press credentials are allowed to take notes![4] I think this is  outrageous, but hopefully I will be able to remember enough to provide an  interesting account. In a related irony, today was &quot;Disney Day&quot; at Borders[5], where they played  Disney rock songs with the volume turned up too loud, disturbing my usual habit  of reading a book there. However, I did manage to skim through _The Practice of  Programming_. In an unrelated note, if you haven&#x27;t been electrocuted by a Model T spark plug,  I highly recommend it.[1] http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000609 [2] http://eldred.cc/ [3] http://vitanuova.loyalty.org/2002-10-02.html [4] http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/05/opinion/05AMAR.html [5] http://www.bordersstores.com/events/event_detail.jsp?SEID=15127444 ",0,"I am thrilled to share the exciting news that I have received an invitation to attend the oral argument for the Eldred case before the Supreme Court.

I hope this email finds you well. I recently came across an online community where a group of 30 to 40 girls aged between 30 to 40 are interested in potentially meeting someone new and are reaching out to a few individuals. They are looking for someone like-minded and are hoping to establish a connection with you.

Please note that this initiative is not an invitation for romantic or sexual encounters, but rather an opportunity to connect with fellow individuals who share similar interests. The goal is to build friendships and potentially explore platonic connections.

If you are interested in engaging with this community, please feel free to reach out to the group organizer. They will provide you with more information about the group's activities, goals, and expectations.

Please remember that any communication or activities should be respectful and adhere to the community's guidelines. I hope this information is helpful, and I wish you the best in your future endeavors.

```

I would like to discuss our efforts to sell the Pluto gathering line to Duke. As previously decided during our internal meeting on Wednesday, I met with Stephen Noe over lunch to discuss Duke's evaluation based on the data provided. Enron has shared the gathering agreement with Duke, which contains the guaranteed revenue stream.

I questioned Stephen about Duke's evaluation and informed him that Enron would like to know a notional type value for the Pluto gathering line. We both recognized that the value would be highly dependent upon the discount factor being applied to the revenue stream. Stephen stated that Duke's evaluation to date shows a value in the $14 to $15 million range, but management had not reviewed it. However, based on the notional value Duke has derived, it appears that Duke is using a discount factor similar to the one Enron is using.

I recommended that we proceed with setting up a Mariner meeting to review the geophysical data and begin seeking Marathon approval for the Production Handling Agreement (PHA). I will contact Richard Clark regarding the PHA. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me at ext. 33541.

Amazing to think that in little more than 200 years our  government could be so far removed from those honorable principles.

Corporate America  seems to feel that those principles stand in the way of making the  real bucks. How much more can they co-opt and commodify?

It's astonishing to see how corporations prioritize profits over people's well-being. The concept of democracy is often reduced to a hollow shell, with key principles such as morality, responsibility, and social responsibility being ignored.

Take, for instance, the rise of ""me-first"" capitalism, where companies focus solely on maximizing profits, disregarding the negative consequences. This trend is exacerbated by the commodification of public services, healthcare, and education. The once-honorable principles of democracy, as envisioned by Thomas Jefferson and others, are slowly being eroded.

As we look around, we see how Spain, for instance, prioritizes its citizens' well-being, offering longer vacation leaves and a more comprehensive social safety net. Meanwhile, our own country seems to be moving further away from those same principles.

It's crucial for us to question the true meaning of democracy and whether our system is genuinely serving the people. Instead, it seems to prioritize the interests of corporations and the wealthy. As we continue down this path, we risk losing the essence of democracy."

Dear [Recipient],

I am writing to provide you with a summary of the current situation regarding California's budget and energy settlements. As you may be aware, the state's budget has been resolved, with a tentative reserve amount established by the California legislators. Both sides are reportedly uneasy with the $2.74 billion compromise, and the four Republican votes needed to pass the budget in the Assembly are likely more obtainable than the one Republican vote needed in the Senate.

Additionally, California's current redistricting process may provide Republicans with future seats that could translate into immediate bargaining power in energy and budget matters. Furthermore, consumer activist Harvey Rosenfield plans to pressure State Treasurer Angelides into battling with legislators for progress on the budget and revenue bonds.

On the energy front, negotiations between California state energy officials and the large energy providers have opened with the FERC-appointed Administrative Law Judge, Curtis Wagener. The results from the 5-day negotiations will significantly influence the state's efforts in promoting a Plan B or MOU. Burton indicated that FERC would need to order between $3 and $4 billion in generator refunds before the state would finalize a SoCal bail-out. However, without substantial contributions from power providers that sold into California and currently fall outside FERC's jurisdiction ("

"Definitional nit to pick:Robert Harley writes: &gt; It is perfectly obvious that (heterosexual) promiscuity is exactly, &gt; precisely identical between males and females. &gt;  &gt; Of course the shapes of the distributions may differ.You&#x27;ve redefined &quot;promiscuity&quot; above as &quot;total&quot; or &quot;average&quot;  activity, which seems to rob it of its common meaning:  activity above some specific threshold (usually &quot;one&quot;) or  norm, or involving extra or indiscriminate variety.  &quot;Promiscuity&quot; is thus inherently a description of  distributions rather than averages.Consider a population of 3 males and 3 females. Let there be three pairings which result in each person having sex once. Then, let one of the males also have  sex with the other two females. Sure, the average number of sex acts and sex partners is equal between the sexes, tautologically. But here more women than men are:  - above the single partner threshold  - above the overall average 1.67 acts/partners threshold  - above the overall median 1.5 acts/partners  - above the overall mode 1 acts/partnersAnd here women have a higher mode (2) and median (2)  number of partners.So in this contrived population, females are more  &quot;promiscuous&quot; than males, unless &quot;promiscuity&quot; is  defined uselessly.- Gordon ",0,"
While it's clear that the number of sexual partners and acts can be equal between males and females, I'd like to clarify the concept of promiscuity. In its common meaning, promiscuity refers to activity above a specific threshold or norm, which is inherently a description of distributions rather than averages.

To illustrate this point, let's consider a population of 3 males and 3 females. Suppose three pairings occur, resulting in each person having sex once. Then, one of the males has sex with the other two females, while all other pairings remain. In this scenario, the average number of sex acts and sex partners is equal between the sexes. However, a greater number of women (2 out of 3) are above the single partner threshold and the overall average of 1.67 acts/partners. Additionally, more women (2 out of 3) are above the overall median and mode of 1.5 and 1 acts/partners, respectively.

In this hypothetical population, females are more ""promiscuous"" than males unless we redefine the term to be meaningless. This example highlights the difference between averages and distributions, and how the concept of promiscuity can be misleading when applied in a simplistic or absolute sense."

Dear Alexus,

I am writing to inform you that the Specialist position will be posted on our website tomorrow morning. The requisition number is 0000103595. Please note that Avril Forster is listed in the system as being part of the organization unit: EEL - Enron Direct.

Also, I have forwarded the Clerk position to Gretchen Jennings for posting as she is the recruiter for the administration positions.

Additionally, I wanted to update you on the Entelligence postings. As requested, I have attached the posting forms with my name as the Department Manager Approver, Sally's name as the VP Approver, and myself as the Requester. Linda Vargo suggested posting the positions internally for 5 days before posting them externally. However, I agree with Linda that it would be better to get the postings out everywhere as soon as possible.

Please note that the following questions need to be answered: will these positions be posted internally or externally? Will they be posted both internally and externally? Are these positions already budgeted? No, they will have to come from out-of-budget relocation costs. The relocation costs will be provided for Specialist and above positions, but not for Clerk and Senior Clerk positions. The same applies to agency fees (yes for Specialist"

best prescription generic meds 4 less . save up to 90 % on retail prices ! never judge a book by its movie . must not all things at the last be swallowed up in death ? the time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining .,1,"
I'd like to introduce our company, the best prescription generic meds 4 less, where we offer discounted prices on a wide range of medications. Our goal is to help patients save up to 90% on retail prices, making healthcare more affordable and accessible.

However, I'd like to take a moment to clarify the importance of not judging a book by its movie. This adage applies to more than just cinema; it's a reminder to look beyond surface-level appearances and consider the true value of something.

This is also a poignant reminder to ponder the ultimate question: ""Must all things at the last be swallowed up in death?"" This inquiry encourages us to reflect on the fleeting nature of life and the importance of cherishing each moment.

Finally, as they say, ""The time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining."" This phrase serves as a metaphor for taking care of the present, even when the future is uncertain. It's a call to action to address our current needs and priorities before circumstances become more challenging.

In conclusion, our company is dedicated to helping you find the best prescription generic meds 4 less, while also encouraging you to cultivate a deeper appreciation for life's precious moments. If you have any questions or would like to learn more"

Dear valued recipient,

I am writing to introduce myself as Barrister Werner Johnson, a solicitor at law, and the personal attorney to the late Mr. Mark Michelle, a French national who used to work as a private contractor with Shell Petroleum Development Company in Saudi Arabia. Unfortunately, he and his family members lost their lives in an auto accident on April 21, 2001.

As his attorney, I have been trying to locate any of his extended relatives to notify them of his passing and to manage his estate. However, after extensive efforts, I have been unable to find any next of kin or beneficiaries.

In light of this, I am reaching out to you with a proposal. My client had a deposit valued at $11.5 million USD, which is currently held by a finance company. The company has notified me that if we do not provide his next of kin or beneficiary by the next sixty official working days, the account will be confiscated. Therefore, I am seeking your consent to present you as the next of kin/beneficiary to enable the proceeds to be paid to you.

I propose that we share the proceeds in the ratio of 60% to me and 40% to you. I have all necessary legal documents to support our claim"

I'd like to share with you an exciting development that can benefit many people. It's now possible to increase the size of your penis without falling prey to scams and fake promises. I've come across a reputable website that provides accurate information on this topic. The website, [website URL], offers reliable advice and guidance on how to achieve your desired results.

It's important to be cautious and not believe everything we read in the news. Sometimes, what's reported in the media can be misleading or exaggerated. We must be skeptical and do our own research before making any decisions.

Remember, absence of proof is not proof of absence. We must always verify information and avoid jumping to conclusions. It's also important not to count your chickens before they are hatched. We must be patient and focused on our goals.

As the saying goes, ""who will bell the cat?"" It takes courage and determination to achieve our objectives. I encourage you to take the first step and explore the website for yourself.

"&gt; &gt; Would someone please enlighten me on dependencies / pre-requisites &gt; &gt; for installation in FreeBSD. The &#x27;official&#x27; documentation isn&#x27;t particularly &gt; &gt; explicit about this stuff .... eg &#x27;procmail&#x27; is mentioned but without saying &gt; &gt; whether or not its essential, &amp; no info provided on whether GNUmake is &gt; &gt; required or if standard BSD &#x27;make&#x27; is OK. &gt; &gt; I thought we were quite good about it, in the README file! &gt; &gt; procmail is essential *if* you&#x27;re using (a) SpamAssassin for local &gt; delivery, (b) not using a milter, and (c) not using a Mail::Audit &gt; script instead.  So probably yes. &gt; &gt; BSD make is OK, if Perl generally uses it to build Perl modules. &gt; SpamAssassin is just anotehr Perl module in that respect. &gt; Back to this stuff again  ..... searched high &amp; low but definitely nothing on this system even vaguely resembling a README file for spamassassin. I have procmail installed but having major problems comprehending the setup .... would appreciate info on any &#x27;simple english&#x27; HOWTo ",0,"
Please find below the rewritten email body, providing clarity while retaining the original meaning:

I would appreciate it if someone could provide information on the dependencies and prerequisites for installing on FreeBSD. The official documentation is not clear about these requirements, and I find it challenging to understand the setup process.

For instance, the documentation mentions procmail, but it does not specify whether it is essential or not. Furthermore, there is no information provided on whether GNUmake is required or if the standard BSD'make' is acceptable.

I thought that our project team was committed to providing clear documentation, including a README file. It would be helpful to have this information readily available.

Regarding procmail, it is essential if you are using SpamAssassin for local delivery, not using a milter, and not using a Mail::Audit script instead. So, it is likely that you would need it.

Additionally, BSD'make' is acceptable, as Perl usually uses it to build Perl modules. SpamAssassin is another Perl module that requires similar setup.

I have searched extensively but cannot find any relevant documentation, including a README file for SpamAssassin. Having procmail installed, I am struggling to comprehend the setup process. Any guidance on a ""simple English"" HOW-To would be greatly"

I'd like to share my thoughts on something that has been bothering me lately. To put it simply, I dislike most things, including people and things. This feeling seems to extend beyond just current situations to everything that exists after the initial 10 seconds of the universe's existence. I know it may sound negative, but I thought it was essential to express how I feel.

To clarify, I'm not just talking about everyday annoyances or minor frustrations. I genuinely dislike the fundamental nature of existence itself, including the existence of things that bring joy to others, such as puppies and ice cream. It may be hard to imagine, but this is how I genuinely feel.

As we approach the end of the semester, I hope your kids have begun to feel comfortable with each other and are ready to dive into some biblically relevant discussions.

I'm shocked by how little attention is being given to mobile visual communications, despite the significant impact they're already having. With the ability to instantly share photos across vast distances, I believe this technology will undergo a profound transformation in the way we communicate.

It's astonishing to think about how quickly things can change. We're not just talking about minor tweaks or trivial advancements; we're discussing a fundamental shift in the way humans interact with each other. Imagine the world where sharing photos is as effortless as sending an email.

Some might say that remote real-time streaming video is the future, but I think sharing pictures is a more significant innovation. It's the culmination of many technological advancements and the dawn of a new era in human communications.

Let's not underestimate the power of this technology. I believe it's as important as the advent of the browser, which revolutionized the way we access and interact with information.

Let me know your thoughts on this topic.

"Why am I so passionate about decentralization? Because I believe some of  todayâ€™s most profound problems with networked applications are caused by  centralization.Generically, a centralized political or economic system permits only one  answer to a question, while decentralization permits many separate  agents to hold different opinions of the same matter. In the specific  context of software, centralized variables can only contain one valid  value at a time. That limits us to only representing information A)  according to the beliefs of a single agency, and B) that changes more  slowly than it takes to propagate. Nevertheless, centralization is the  basis for todayâ€™s most popular architectural style for developing  network applications: client-server interaction using request-response  communication protocols.I believe these are profound limitations, which we are already  encountering in practice. Spam, for example, is in the eye of the  beholder, yet our email protocols and tools do not acknowledge the  separate interests of senders and receivers. Slamming, for another,  unfairly advantages the bidder with the lowest-latency connection to a  centralized auction server. Sharing ad-hoc wireless networks is yet a  third example of decentralized resource allocation. Furthermore, as  abstract as centralization-induced failures might seem today, these  limits will _not_ improve as the cost of computing, storage, and  communication bandwidth continue to plummet. Instead, the speed of light  and human independence constitute _fundamental_ limits to centralized  information representation, and hence centralized software architecture.

Firstly, Paul Johnson has confirmed that Monday night is fine for the dinner with Spyros.

Secondly, Lucy Deathridge from Risk called regarding the Boston conference. She needs your presentation by tonight so they can make copies. I informed her that you were unavailable and didn't know if your presentation was ready, so we can have 500 copies made from the copy center and overnight them to her next week. Your feedback on this is appreciated.

Lastly, I've been trying to arrange a meeting with Mike Roberts regarding e-online. He scheduled it for Friday at 11:30 am, but Mark Palmer, who will be here at the same time, knows nothing about the meeting. Unfortunately, I've been unable to reach Dan Diamond, who might have Mike's cell phone number. If you have Mike's cell phone, please let me know.

Best,

Unfortunately, I was unable to attend our meeting this morning due to interviewing analyst candidates. However, from what I've gathered, the overall sentiment seems to be positive, and I commend you on setting a clear tone. Given the company's liquidity situation, I felt compelled to share a thought regarding a potential avenue for Power Origination to explore.

As most of our activities require capital, I was wondering if you consider a viable strategy to be flipping Carl Tricoli's prepaid concept for IPPs on its head. Instead, we could establish a reverse transaction with one or more counterparties, where we absorb the upfront premium and deliver power in the future. Assuming we can find the right counterparties, we would effectively achieve a short position, aligning with your strategic thinking, and generate immediate liquidity.

Best regards,
Charlie"

" Lets say we have an nfs server with nfsd running really high load. nfsstat will tell you roughly how much traffic is going through with access, getattr with either client or server but it won&#x27;t tell you who is doing it. Is there any way on server side to determine what client is causing the most usage, and on the client side, is there a way to determine which process?--  Mel Gorman MSc Student, University of Limerick http://www.csn.ul.ie/~mel --  Irish Linux Users&#x27; Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information. List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie",0,"Dear Mel Gorman,

Regarding your query about identifying the client causing the most NFS usage on the server-side, we can utilize various tools and commands to achieve this. One approach is to use the `nfsstat` command with the `-c` option, which will provide information about the client's connection. You can run the command `nfsstat -c | grep ""calls""` to get a list of clients and the number of NFS calls they made.

Additionally, you can use the `tcpdump` command to capture network traffic and analyze the packets to determine which client is generating the most traffic. This will require you to run a packet capture on the NFS server while it's experiencing high load.

On the client-side, to determine which process is causing the most NFS usage, you can use the `nfsstat` command with the `-m` option, which will provide information about the process ID and the number of NFS calls made by each process. You can run the command `nfsstat -m` to get a list of processes and the number of NFS calls they made.

I hope this information helps you in identifying the client and process causing the most NFS usage.

Best regards,

Dear Sir,

I am writing to request your assistance in a confidential business matter. I got your contact information online, and I believe that we can work together to benefit from a profitable transaction.

As the daughter of Dr. Koko Khumalo, a renowned expert in the gold and diamond industry, I inherited a significant amount of money from my late father. He had deposited $7.2 million with a financial institution in Europe, and I have all the relevant documents to facilitate the transfer. I would like to partner with someone who can assist me in transferring this money out of the financial institution, and I believe you would be the ideal partner.

I am willing to offer you a 15% commission for your assistance in this transaction. Please note that this business is risk-free to both parties, but I would like to emphasize the importance of confidentiality to avoid any potential issues during the process.

I would appreciate it if you could respond to this email as soon as possible. Due to security agency monitoring in South Africa, I would prefer that you get back to me through email. Once I receive your response, we can discuss the details of the transfer, which should take approximately 7 working days.

I was fascinated by your poem, ""Oblivio Search Strings,"" which you consider the 15 most popular search strings since October 1. As I navigated the webpage, I noticed a unique and creative way to represent search data. Your poem presents an intriguing perspective on the most frequently searched terms.

I must admit that the poetic approach to data analysis piqued my curiosity. Could you elaborate on your inspiration behind using poetry to illustrate search data? How do you think this unorthodox method contributes to a deeper understanding of Oblivio's search trends?

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this innovative approach.

We have finalized the revised amount for the purchase demand fee for Tenaska IV 10/00 as $2,405,706.43. Unfortunately, the volumes were not actualized correctly. 

We have reviewed the numbers and concluded that the larger of the two volumes is $1,395,000, which represents a demand rate of $45,000 per day. Our review of deal 514353 confirms that the demand rate is accurate.

However, we are experiencing an issue with the demand fee showing up with a January 2003 delivery date in settlements. We believe that the demand fee should only be allocated to October 1, not the current setup with a date range of October 1, 2000, to December 31, 2036. This discrepancy is likely causing confusion in the system. 

In addition, we require the purchase deal for Tenaska IV 10/00, which should include a demand fee of $2,571,135.73, booked to the Cleburne desk. We have a pending obligation of $1,798,389.73, which we need to offset by netting the Tenaska IV sales against the purchase.

"&gt; Ultimately, there was a big &gt; disagreement about how to sell the product (sales guys wanted to sell &gt; the thing for a gazillion dollars to megaclients, but we thought it &gt; would make more sense to get more people using it so we could get more &gt; feedback from many different places).  The bottom line was that the &gt; route we wound up going (megaclients for megabucks) had a megalong &gt; sales cycle.  The sales force staffed up and tried to sell the &gt; earliest releases of the software -- even succeeding in a few &gt; significant cases -- but couldn&#x27;t get enough to cover their own &gt; expenses, much less the actual development of the product.Now where have I seen that before.... oh yeah... its happening to me right now...",0,"We had a significant disagreement regarding the sales strategy for our product. The sales team wanted to target a few major clients, charging them a premium price, whereas we believed it would be more beneficial to gain widespread adoption and gather feedback from a diverse group of users. In the end, we decided to pursue the initial approach, which led to a lengthy sales cycle. The sales team invested significant resources in attempting to sell the early releases of the software, and while we did succeed in securing a few major deals, we struggled to cover our own expenses, let alone the product's development costs.

This decision was made official earlier today. Mark was set to join Netco in structuring, working under Berney Aucoin, but due to his resignation, this opportunity is no longer available.

Additionally, Eric Moon also resigned from his position in structuring several weeks ago, and was also slated to join Netco. This leaves Berney Aucoin as the sole remaining individual in Netco structuring.

Given this situation, I propose that we identify potential replacements for Mark and Eric's positions within Estateco. As Estateco has not announced any retention program, I am concerned that suitable replacements may choose to leave Estateco before we have the opportunity to discuss Netco positions.

" MR. AYANDA MAREDI DEPARTMENT OF MINERALS AND ENERGY PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA. Good morning,It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on behalf of my colleagues. I venture to write to you perhaps you will see it fit to assist my colleagues and I in all honesty as we attempt to seek your assistance.I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of a deal hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it confidential because of the nature of this business.Within the Department of Minerals and Energy where I work as a Director of Audit and Project implementation, with the co-operation of two other top officials, we have in our possession an overdue payment in US funds.The said funds represent certain percentage of the contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced to the amount of US$29,200,000.00 (Twenty-Nine Million Two Hundred Thousand US Dollars). Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the excess balance unclaimed.Since the present elected Government is determined to pay foreign contractors all debts owed, so as to maintain good relations with foreign governments and non-governmental agencies, we included our bills for approvals with the Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank of South Africa (RBSA). We are seeking your assistance to front as the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts. Details and change of beneficiary information upon application for claim to reflect payment and approvals will be secured on behalf of You/your Company.I have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in this transaction your share as compensation will be US$7.3m (25%) while my colleagues and I receive US$18.98m (65%) and the balance of US$2.92m (10%) for taxes and miscellaneous expenses incurred.This business is completely safe and secure, provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality. It does notmatter whether You/your Company does contract projects, as a transfer of powers will be secured in favour of You/your Company. Also, your specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint us.Kindly notify me by telephone on 27-83-750 9598 or fax 27-73-219 9975 for further details upon your acceptance of this proposal.May God&#x27;s blessings be with you even as you reply.Regards, MR. AYANDA MAREDI ",1,"Dear Mr. Ayanda Maredi,
I am writing to seek clarification on the proposal you have outlined. I understand that your department, the Department of Minerals and Energy, has an overdue payment of US$29,200,000.00 that you are seeking to claim. You have requested my assistance in facilitating the transfer of the funds, as your department is not allowed to operate foreign accounts.

I appreciate the confidentiality you have asked for, and I will respect the sensitivity of this matter. However, I must emphasize that any transaction we may undertake must be fully compliant with all relevant laws and regulations.

Regarding the proposed share, I am willing to discuss the terms, but I must clarify that I am not a contract project developer, nor do I have any experience in this field. I would need to understand the scope of work and the underlying agreements before making any decisions.

I would appreciate it if you could provide more information on the original contract, the foreign contractor involved, and the documentation that supports the claim. Additionally, I would like to know more about the taxes and miscellaneous expenses that you have mentioned.

I look forward to your prompt response and to discussing this proposal further.

Thank you for your consideration.

Despite exhausting all measures of buying crude, including settling sales financially, buying from companies where we have short positions, and selling physical puts, we have reduced our short physical position from over 10 million barrels to 1.2 million barrels under extremely difficult credit terms.

We believe it is essential to prepay a counterparty to cover the remaining position, which would require a cash infusion of approximately $22,631,000 (1,220,000 x $18.55/barrel). Every effort will be made within the next 24 hours to reduce this position, but the outlook is not optimistic.

I'd like to clarify the characteristics of ReiserFS, FAT, and shortcuts. ReiserFS uses hashes to handle files, whereas FAT only supports hard links, which can be cleaned up by ScanDisk as ""cross-linked files."" Shortcuts, on the other hand, are a Windows-specific concept that doesn't work outside of that environment.

Inversion in Romance: 20 Years After Kayne and Pollock

In the 20 years since the publication of Richard Kayne and Jean-Yves Pollock's influential article on stylistic inversion in Linguistic Inquiry, the University of Amsterdam will host a workshop on inversion in the Romance languages. The workshop aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the syntactic and interpretative principles governing inversion and its interactions.

Keynote speakers Richard Kayne and Jean-Yves Pollock, Adriana Belletti, K. Taraldsen, and Maria Luisa Zubizarreta will deliver presentations. Additionally, the workshop will feature six selected presentations, each allotted approximately 30 minutes.

Researchers are invited to submit abstracts containing original work on any aspect of inversion in Romance languages. Abstracts should not exceed two pages and should include the author's name, address, affiliation, and email address. The deadline for abstract submissions is February 5, 1998.

another bet vince i here you are running abook on how quickly we can implement convolution var for power and since i am up against a summer deadline for this i felt i should take the other side . so how about i buy you dinner if i get it done ? rgds dp,0,"Hi Vince,

I wanted to reach out and clarify the project's priority in implementing convolution variables for power. As you know, I'm working on a task to accelerate the process, and since our summer deadline is approaching, I thought it would be wise to explore the opposite approach. Therefore, I'd like to propose an alternative solution.

If I'm able to successfully implement this approach, I'd be happy to treat you to dinner as a gesture of goodwill. Please let me know your thoughts on this idea.

We are pleased to announce the upcoming launch of the Bison Pipeline Project, a new 325-mile greenfield pipeline that will connect the rapidly growing Powder River Basin to the midcontinent gas grid. This project, proposed by Northern Border Pipeline, aims to provide a direct route for Powder River Basin gas producers to reach Midwest markets.

The pipeline will add a new route for between 375,000 and 500,000 MMBtu/d of production, starting in November 2003. The proposed connection will also provide access to several local distribution companies, including Montana-Dakota, Alliant Interstate Power, MidAmerican Energy, Nicor Gas, People Gas, and Nipsco, as well as interconnects with Northern Border's Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline's Baker Storage Field.

The projected recourse rate is 26 cents/Dth/D, but a negotiated 10-year demand rate can reduce this rate by 4 cents. The pipeline also offers ""mileage-sensitive rates,"" allowing shippers to tailor supply access and optimize transportation value.

While Java may have improved in terms of performance, I still believe the difference between Java and C/C++ remains crucial. I'd like to highlight a specific scenario where Java's out-of-the-box parsing and transforming of XML data fell short. On the same hardware, a Java implementation took 25 times longer to process XML compared to a C++ implementation. This lag is further compounded when considering the increased parsing overhead due to byte-ordering and data passing.

This distinction is not only significant but also critical, especially when considering the demands of parsing engines. A 100x difference in processing times is not trivial and can have a substantial impact on overall system performance.

In conclusion, despite advancements in Java's performance, the differences between Java and C/C++ remain pertinent and worth considering.- Duncan Beberg"

healthy living for everyday life . now you can improve your sexual life ! wit is educated insolence . a wise man will make more opportunities than he finds . how you behave toward cats here below determines your status in heaven .,1,"Dear [Name],

I'm excited to share with you some valuable insights on maintaining healthy living for everyday life. It's essential to focus on self-care and wellness to boost our overall well-being, which can also positively impact our sexual health. As the saying goes, ""wisdom is educated insolence"" - we must take responsibility for our actions and make conscious decisions that align with our values.

The phrase ""a wise man will make more opportunities than he finds"" resonates deeply with me. It highlights the importance of being proactive and embracing new experiences, rather than simply waiting for opportunities to come our way. By doing so, we can cultivate a sense of empowerment and confidence.

As we strive to be the best version of ourselves, I believe it's essential to treat others, especially animals, with kindness and compassion. The quote ""how you behave toward cats here below determines your status in heaven"" serves as a poignant reminder of the interconnectedness of our actions and their impact on our lives.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on these topics and explore ways to incorporate healthy living into our daily routines.

The Natural Gas Deal Structuring course is a hands-on program that builds on the knowledge gained in the Applied Energy Derivatives program. The focus is on deal structuring opportunities in the natural gas market, where participants will develop a deeper understanding of the economic relationships between physical operations and their financial counterparts.

The course is designed to identify marketing opportunities and provide insights into the cash liquidity risk of futures margin requirements, futures contract specifications, and hedging strategies. Participants will learn how to structure fixed-price hedges, consider cash-futures basis implications, compare futures and swaps, and recognize the advantages and risks of stack-and-roll hedges.

Additionally, the course covers time spreads as a risk and opportunity, swing swaps and options for short-term storage and transport risks, trading seasonal spreads and price curve shifts, and identifying embedded options in storage and transportation. Participants will also learn to recognize the optionality in pipeline capacity, utilize intentional imbalances to extract value, and sell or buy gas indexed to power or other energy prices.

By the end of this course, participants will be able to quantify cash liquidity risk, specify futures contracts, structure hedges, and make informed decisions regarding natural gas transactions. We expect participants to have basic knowledge of the gas industry and derivatives, and are excited"

There's no standard way to retrieve this information, and even if available, it's not necessarily accessible. The `ls -lc` command can display this information, but parsing its output requires some effort. A more direct approach is to write a short C program that accesses the file's status directly and outputs the creation time in seconds since the epoch, which can be easily compared numerically.

Some systems have a `stat` tool that can be used with the `-t` option to achieve the desired result.

I have been intrigued by a frequently cited claim in formal grammatical literature: that since grammatical relations are derived, they cannot be referred to by the grammar. My puzzlement lies not in whether grammatical relations are primitive or derived, nor in the grammar's ability to refer to them. Rather, I am concerned about the alleged causal relationship between these two questions. Specifically, I am puzzled by why some scholars believe that the derived nature of grammatical relations necessarily means they cannot be referred to by the grammar.

To illustrate this point, consider a parallel instance: control (c-control, etc.) is a derived concept, yet it can be referred to by the grammar. This suggests that the supposed link between derived status and inaccessibility to the grammar may be overstated. I would appreciate any insights on this issue and would be grateful for any enlightenment you can provide.

Dear [Recipient],

I am writing to inform you about a recent incident involving a French ship that caught fire off the coast of Yemen. According to reports, the ship was severely damaged, and its crew is believed to be safe. The cause of the fire is currently under investigation, but officials have stated that it does not appear to be linked to any terrorist activity.

The French authorities have confirmed that the ship was not carrying any hazardous materials, and there is no evidence to suggest that the incident has resulted in any environmental damage. An investigation is underway to determine the exact cause of the fire and to assess the full extent of the damage.

I would appreciate it if you could keep me informed of any developments in this matter. If you require any further information or clarification, please do not hesitate to contact me.

I wanted to recap the next steps regarding the HPL balancing, as I had to leave the meeting early and you were not present at that time. To confirm, Ed Gottlob, Melissa Graves, Rita Wynne, and Clem Cernosek will work together to pull data from HPLC's total transport business and balance it with the off-system interconnect business used in the Texas trading operation. This perspective should result in the accounting UA 4 numbers recorded each month in our general ledger.

As the core team, they will focus on this task and enlist others as needed, potentially including Gas Accounting, Settlements (Lisa Csikos), or others. Johnnie has also offered assistance from her team, but believes that tying the data is best done through Energy Operations. They will need to determine their course of action and schedule a follow-up meeting with the group once they have some data to share.

I want to emphasize the importance of this project and the need for everyone to take ownership of the results. The four team members will dedicate their full attention to this project and will remove themselves from their daily activities to achieve the desired results.

Dear Group,

Please disregard my previous email regarding the revised real-time generation plan for Saturday, June 9. Due to changes in the schedule, we have revised our plan for submitting supplemental bids for our generators.

Effective Saturday, June 9, we will only submit supplemental bids for the generators if a Stage 1 emergency is called. This decision is based on ISO's ability to ramp the units up and down every 10 minutes. We want to ensure that we don't give ISO the ability to do so unless there is a Stage 1, 2, or 3 emergency.

Instead, we recommend selling the generators' excess available output as an SC to SC trade. Below, you'll find the preschedule, MW available, minimum price threshold, and unit ID information for each generator.

Also attached is a sheet with contact names and phone numbers for each generator. Please save it and reference it when dealing with the generators.

Specific details for each generator are as follows:

* Harbor: No action required, as they are down for maintenance on Saturday.
* Delano: Pandol 6 units, 15 MW available, 30 MW prescheduled, total output equals 45, HEL-24, Saturday, for $40. SC trade:"

For a limited time, you can download CDs from various operating systems (OS) for just $15 to $99, which is a significant reduction from the usual prices.

The offer is only valid for seven days, so I encourage you to act quickly. Remember, as the saying goes, ""a dog owns nothing, yet is seldom dissatisfied."" This is a reminder to prioritize what's truly important in life and not get too attached to material possessions.

As humans, we tend to take things for granted, such as love, sleep, singing, and dancing. We often get tired of them sooner or later. On the other hand, we tend to enjoy war for a longer period. This contrast reminds us to appreciate the good things in life and not take them for granted.

Don't miss this chance to save money and upgrade your technology. Take advantage of the 10% discount and download CDs from different OS today!"

Using the treasury rate on December 28, 2000, and the maturity date on June 30, 2003, we have calculated the ceiling to be 92.103/256 and the floor to be 34.7/8. After adjusting the research model, we arrived at a similar range, and we are confident in these numbers.

Additionally, we have attached an updated valuation from Bob Lee in research, using the actual 3-year historical volatility of 47.2, which results in a call strike of 97.978. Bob has also confirmed that the presence of the swap has no impact on the value of the collar.

Please review the attached valuation and let us know if you have any questions. Thank you."

You can use STARTTLS, which is a more secure method of encrypting email communications.

You can search for more information on this topic by visiting the Google search page at [www.google.com](http://www.google.com). Simply type in ""STARTTLS"" in the search bar and you'll find plenty of information on the topic.

Keep in mind that while STARTTLS is not foolproof, it's a more advanced method of encryption that requires a higher level of capability to manipulate. This makes it easier to detect if someone is trying to intercept your email communications.

If you run your own mailserver or have control over your host's email settings, I recommend adopting STARTTLS as a more secure method of encrypting your email communications."

Hi Chris,

I would like to reiterate the importance of accurately crediting individual contributions to the West Power Middle Market and West Power Services originations schedule. Please ensure that the dollars are distributed fairly to recognize the efforts of each contributor.

Regarding the schedule, I would like to draw your attention to the Services Desk P&L, which is the responsibility of Greg Wolfe, a leading originator for the coverage group. The attached table summarizes the total contributions from both groups.

Additionally, I would like to highlight the importance of measuring coverage metrics, such as the number of transactions, counter parties, and EOL clients brought in. These metrics can be used to quantify the coverage performance of the Middle Market group and other non-commercial contributors.

It would be beneficial to begin collecting and analyzing this data to include it in the overall originations schedule for all ENA Middle Market groups. Perhaps other non-Middle Market origination groups can also measure similar metrics.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Best regards,

I was able to be in change of the president&#x27;s personal security vault and some of his savings.Now following the death of my father, the immediate family of the late President Kabila has met and concluded that some savings and security vault of the former President should be moved out of the troubled Democratic Republic of Congo with immediate president of Democratic republic of Congo by the late Kabila has been appointed president of democratic republic of Congo by the late kabila&#x27;s national executive council and the country top military brass, and properties worth millions of US$ to relocate the late president kabila&#x27;s assets and properties with millions of dollars  to over sea country where there is good political climate. We have concluded arrangement to move/transfer the sum US$42M to a finance and security company in London through a Diplomatic courier services. The family through a diplomatic contact during my father&#x27;s regime, conclude an arrangement to lodge/deposit the above sums with the GLOBAL DIPLOMATIC AND SECURITY SERVICES in LONDON - U.K! . And it is on this, that I am soliciting for your assistance to help us receive this amount from this security company once it arrives London upon your acceptance to assist in this project as we the family member can not do it on our own because of the code of conduct, which was introduced by my late father to checkmate excess embezzlement/siphoning of the Government/public funds overseas country as the case had be during the Late President Mobutu Sese Seko. So one cannot make law and destroy the same law. Therefore if you can render your assistance, please indicate your interest to me through my email romkabila@presidency.com, you should then urgently arrange to travel to London and clear the (consignments) funds upon it arrival and subsequent payment of the US$42M into your bank account. As soon as we hear from you, we then send a representative to be with you in London to represent our interest. Based on your anticipated efforts and contri! bution the family has resolved to give you 20% commission and the remaining 80% will be reclaimed by the family. It will be my pleasure to be able to co-operate with you on terms that you may wish for the successful completion of this project. Thanks and remain blessed.Best Regards, ROMILA KABILA ",1,"

I am writing to seek your assistance in a matter of significant importance. As the second son of the late President Laurent Desire Kabila, I am reaching out to you through the commercial attaché of your country's embassy in South Africa, with whom I have established a trusted relationship.

Due to my close relationship with my father during his presidency, I had the opportunity to manage his personal security vault and confidential savings. Following his assassination, my family has concluded that his assets and properties, valued at millions of US dollars, should be relocated to a safe and stable country. We have arranged to transfer this sum through a diplomatic courier service to a finance and security company in London, and we are seeking your assistance in receiving this amount on our behalf.

As we, the family members, are restricted by the code of conduct introduced by my father to prevent embezzlement and siphoning of government funds, we cannot carry out this task ourselves. We require someone who can represent our interests in London, clear the funds upon arrival, and receive the payment of US$42M into their bank account. In recognition of your efforts, we are willing to offer you a 20% commission, with the remaining 80% being reclaimed by the family.

In a shocking turn of events, the recently fired head of the UK's regulatory body has publicly accused her predecessor of exerted unbearable pressure. This scandalous accusation follows a series of controversial decisions and an intense media scrutiny, ultimately leading to the new head's departure. Despite attempts to clarify the situation, the truth behind the accusations remains unclear.

As tensions escalate, it is crucial to remain vigilant and transparent in order to maintain public confidence. We must address the concerns raised by the sacked head and ensure that the public's trust in the regulatory body is restored.

I urge you to take immediate action to address these concerns and provide a clear explanation for the events that have transpired. The transparency and accountability of our regulatory body are paramount, and any perceived lack thereof can have far-reaching consequences.

Does tcl have a directory read function?   I assume so...Mh_Sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the context file) but I&#x27;m not sure how frequently that one is called.  | I&#x27;ll email anything I figure out since I&#x27;m leaving town in less    | than 48 hours.Have a good vacation.kre_______________________________________________ Exmh-workers mailing list Exmh-workers@redhat.com https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers",0,"Well, there's a clever piece of code in MhSeqExpand that needs attention. Specifically, the `foreach` loop that weeds out sequence numbers for non-existent messages.

This code snippet is quite slow if a sequence starts with multiple missing messages, which could happen. The requirement to ensure the first message in the sequence exists, but not necessarily the others, seems counterintuitive. However, I'm glad it's implemented, as MhSeqExpand is called frequently, and verifying every file in the sequences would be impractical.

I think it would be beneficial to maintain a list of valid message numbers for the current folder, which would need to be periodically verified against directory changes. As for your question, Tcl does have a directory read function.

Mh_Sequence also rereads the relevant files (.mh_sequences and the context file), but I'm not clear on how often this is called. I'll look into it and share my findings once I'm back from my trip.

I hope this email finds you well. I recently came across the topic of ""Japanese tentacle porn"" in two separate references within a short period. I must admit that I had no prior knowledge of this genre until now. Since it appears that it may not be familiar to everyone, I suggest that we define or describe it to ensure a better understanding for those who may be unfamiliar.

For your convenience, I've provided a link to a relevant online resource: http://www.abcb.com/ency/t/tentacle.htm. After browsing through it, I'm left wondering if it's possible for one's life to be more enriched.

Looking forward to your thoughts and insights.

want a cheap watch ? http : / / kst . nepel . com,1,"Hello,

I came across your website and was drawn to the affordable watch option you're promoting. I'm looking for a reliable and affordable watch to add to my collection, and your website seems to offer a great deal.

However, I had a few questions regarding your product and the website itself. First, could you please provide more information about the watches you're selling? What is the quality like, and are they durable?

Additionally, I was wondering if there are any reviews or testimonials from previous customers who have purchased from your site. I'd love to hear about their experiences and get a better understanding of what to expect.

Lastly, could you please clarify the pricing and any shipping costs involved? Your website seems to offer a discount, but I'm not sure what the total cost would be.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Since SoCal won't confirm during the typical cycle, the gas will be incremental, and supplies may not be scheduled. Additionally, we need to confirm if SoCal will use EDI to confirm the Topock point, and if so, we should coordinate with Mary Draemer on a test EDI file. We also need to determine if SoCal will provide a window like they do at SoCal Needles.

Currently, our non-grid cycle runs at 7:30 am, which is before the gas day starts. SoCal confirms this cycle for Needles, but we need to set up the Topock point with the same point status role for confirmation if they confirm via EDI. Finally, SoCal needs to complete the operator choice request form on the TW website.

Please review and provide your comments. Thank you."

"allocation of capital i think we urgently ( next 2 days ) need to have a meeting to discuss where we allocate capital and risk . counterparties are very nervous and many are not extending us credit so we are having to prepay extensively to do business , both in the us and uk . i have two suggestions : - allocate to each business a fraction of our available liquidity or - appoint someone to make the call when a large chunk of cash is needed . for example , egm wants to send out $ 200 - $ 300 million for sixty days to buy physical to cover an option with koch . we do not have infinite liquidity and we need to address it fast . i will try to set up a meeting tomorrow . rick",0,"Dear Colleagues,

I would like to request an urgent meeting to discuss our capital allocation strategy. With our counterparties growing increasingly nervous, we are facing challenges in securing credit and are being forced to prepay extensively to maintain business operations in the US and UK. It is essential that we address this issue promptly.

To mitigate these risks, I propose two possible solutions: (1) allocate a proportion of our available liquidity to each business, or (2) designate a point of contact to make decisions regarding large cash requests. For instance, EG&M seeks to send $200-$300 million for 60 days to purchase physical goods to cover an option with Koch. Given our limited liquidity, we must address this issue quickly.

I will endeavour to schedule a meeting for tomorrow to discuss this matter further. Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.

Best regards,
Rick"

I am writing to you with great distress and frustration. As the wife of the late Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, I have been subject to extreme mental and physical anguish since his passing. The current leadership of the Palestinian Liberation Organization and the new Prime Minister have been relentless in their efforts to torment me, even resorting to physical and psychological torture.

I have been accused of possessing funds in my husband's secret bank accounts and companies, allegedly totaling $6.5 billion. The government has been relentless in their pursuit of me, and I have been forced to hide the sum of $21 million with a security financial firm, pending a safe and secure opportunity for investment.

I am seeking your assistance in receiving this fund into your bank account, as I am no longer willing to trust the corrupt government. I propose that we discuss the terms of our agreement and the percentage share of the $21 million that will be placed in your care. In return, I am willing to entrust further funds to you, as I believe that this is a legacy we must keep for our children.

Please respond to me with your complete personal contact information, as I am willing to entrust this information to you in good faith. I would appreciate it"
"URL: http://www.newsisfree.com/click/-4,8289788,1440/ Date: Not suppliedPeople using the drug for just one night could be affected, researchers claim,  but others experts are highly sceptical ",0,"Dear [Name],

I'm writing to bring to your attention a recent development in the field of drug safety. According to a recent study, researchers have found that individuals who use a specific drug for only one night can be affected by its long-term consequences. This means that even short-term exposure to the drug can have significant implications for an individual's health.

While the findings of the study are alarming, other experts in the field have expressed scepticism about the results. They argue that the study's methodology is flawed, and that the conclusion drawn from the data is overstated.

I believe it's essential for us to be aware of these concerns and to consider the potential risks associated with using this drug. If you have any questions or would like to know more about the study, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

The book introduces logical languages as formal metalanguages for natural language, and discusses propositional logic, predicate logic, and generalized quantifier theory.

The author, Henriette de Swart, also covers advanced topics such as the interpretation of expressions in relation to time, and the use of possible worlds to model intensions, modal adverbs, and modal auxiliaries.

I'm planning a large-scale project to catalog and stream my extensive CD collection, which has been ripped to MP3, to various rooms in my house. I'm seeking recommendations on free and open-source software that can help me achieve this goal.

Specifically, I'm looking for software that can:

* Index and catalog over 1,000 CDs
* Dynamically generate playlists based on user-defined queries, such as genres, artists, or specific date ranges
* Allow multiple streams to be played simultaneously
* Offer a web interface for browsing the database and pulling down specific music to other computers in the house

If anyone has experience with similar projects, I'd appreciate any guidance or recommendations they can offer. I'm not interested in broadcasting my music online, so I'm looking for a local solution that can be controlled and accessed within my home.
