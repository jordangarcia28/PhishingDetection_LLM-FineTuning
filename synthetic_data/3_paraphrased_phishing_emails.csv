We invite applications for a three-quarter-time postdoctoral research position in the Language Production Research Unit at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, the Netherlands. The appointment will last three years.

As a postdoctoral researcher, you will contribute to our project on lexical access, which investigates the process of spoken word production from accessing a lexical concept to the initiation and execution of a word's articulation in context. Our project relies heavily on reaction time experimentation and computational modeling, with connections to brain imaging work in the institute.

We are seeking a candidate with a PhD in a relevant cognitive science (such as psycholinguistics, phonology, or phonetics) who has a strong background in reaction time experimentation and lexical/sub-lexical phonology. This combination of skills is particularly important, as phonological encoding of words is a central theme in our project.

Dear esteemed assistant,

I am writing to inform you of a confidential business proposal. As the branch manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria, Lagos branch, I have a unique opportunity to work with you.

A fixed deposit of $25 million, made by Mr. Barry Kelly, a foreign oil consultant, has been sitting in our bank since June 6, 1999. Due to his untimely death, the deposit's ownership has not been claimed. Nigerian law dictates that if the owner does not come forward within six years, the fund will revert to the government. To avoid this, I have sought the assistance of Global & Basic Financial Company to facilitate the transfer of the fund to Holland.

I require your cooperation to facilitate this transaction. As the owner of the fund, I will engage the services of an attorney to draft and notarize the necessary documents, obtaining a letter of probate and administration in your favor. Please note that this transaction will be entirely risk-free, as all paperwork will be handled by the attorney and my position as branch manager guarantees its success.

I request that you provide your full name and address immediately, so I can prepare the necessary documents and affidavits. Confidentiality is paramount, and I assure you that this transaction will be"

It seems you're questioning the relevance of the system's foundation in genealogical tracking to the discussion at hand. I assume you're not suggesting that someone's religion should be a factor in evaluating their qualifications or integrity. Instead, you're highlighting the importance of distinguishing between religious beliefs and cult-like tendencies.

Your concern appears to revolve around the border between religion and cult, particularly in cases where individuals or groups demonstrate paranoid behavior. You also mention the similarity in job descriptions between the Mormon church's management and others, implying that this might not be a unique issue.

Please clarify what specific aspects of this situation concern you, and how you believe they relate to the broader discussion on US politics. Additionally, you mentioned your personal experience with your ex-wife's excommunication from the Mormon church, which seems unrelated to the topic. Would you like to elaborate on this connection?

Regarding your concern about running the command as a specific user (e.g., ""root""), I recommend checking the command's documentation or seeking guidance from the Razor community. It's possible that the command requires elevated privileges to function correctly. Please review the command's usage and dependencies to determine the necessary permissions.

You can try reinstalling the RPM packages or updating Perl to a newer version to resolve the issue. If that doesn't work, you can also try debugging the error by checking the SpamAssassin log files for more information about the error.

I'm excited to share with you a groundbreaking discovery that has the potential to transform your life. Our male sexual enhancement formula is now available, allowing you to naturally enlarge your penis. This is not just a myth, but a reality that can be achieved through our scientifically-backed formula.

I've experienced both sides of the coin – financial success and struggle. Let me tell you, there's no comparison. Wealth and prosperity bring a sense of security and confidence that's hard to replicate in times of scarcity.

As I always say, ""When you've got it, flaunt it!"" And I'm not just talking about material possessions. When you're confident in your abilities and your worth, you're unstoppable.

But, I want to emphasize that winning isn't everything. It's the only thing. The pursuit of success is what drives us to push beyond our limits and strive for excellence.

On a more personal note, I've learned and forgotten many valuable lessons along the way. And I believe that kindness is a key component in both of these processes. It reminds us to be humble, to learn from our mistakes, and to remember the wisdom of our experiences.

Which meant that even when compromised it was only possible to examine other users data.  AFAIR(emember) they just swapped CD&#x27;s when a root exploit was found.&gt; Thanks for any opinions,NPblaze your trail -- redhat&#x27;I am become Shiva, destroyer of worlds&#x27; ",0,"Hi Ben,

I'd like to clarify your email regarding applying the concept of moving sensitive data to a separate partition to application servers, database server partitions, and even the database server itself. You suggested that this concept could be used to protect sensitive information, and I'd like to understand if this is a new idea or if others are already doing this.

I was intrigued by your example of a shell server using a CD-WR in a CD-R drive to separate root from user data, where compromised data could only be examined and swapping CDs occurred when a root exploit was found.

I'd appreciate any insights or opinions on this concept and if anyone else has implemented this solution.

Thank you,

After reviewing the original messages, I agree with Dave and others that the services agreement should be invisible to the market, and Newco should be seen as the counterparty. The agreement should only pertain to the time Newco doesn't have the staff to service it, as short as possible. I fully agree with the sentiments expressed by Dave and others, and I recommend we proceed in this manner.

In summary, we should aim for an agreement that is short-term, focuses on the business relationship, and provides maximum benefit to the estate. This aligns with the views expressed by David McMahon and others. I believe this approach will result in a win-win situation for all parties involved.

I'd like to know the official ""apt"" line for this beta version. Is it just rpm 7.4, or did they upgrade it to 8.0?

In my humble opinion, I've been saying this for years, and almost no one listened. People would rather stick with Windows, citing that it's easier and they don't want to learn anything new. I'd love to see how easy it is to try something new. For instance, a recent article highlights the ease of switching to Linux: http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4477138,00.html"

I've pushed the master plan to Jim Fallon, and I believe it will be difficult, if not impossible, to move everyone by Tuesday. I've also forwarded my email to Jim, and I'm sure he'll handle it.

As for your request, I've got approximately 100+ people, mainly on floor 5, but some remain on floor 6. I think it will be tough to move everyone in such a short timeframe, especially considering Jim's wholesale group is still unclear. However, I've forwarded this email to him, and I'm sure he'll take care of it.

This is because any granting of &gt; rights by an author must be clearly delimited in terms of how long, &gt; where, to whom, dates and times.The GPL and similar licences are explicitly permanent grants of rights attached to an instance of his work.  (The other stuff mentioned concerns contract law, e.g., the required element of privity, etc.)&gt; In the absence of such limitations, the original author has the right &gt; to change his software back to closed on a whim.No, the author has the right to issue _additional_ instances under a different licence, such as a proprietary (&quot;closed&quot; [sic]) licence.  &gt; Rick Moen makes the point that it is not a sale but rather a granting &gt; of rights which are not default.  &gt;  &gt; See the bit about even the granting of rights by an author having to &gt; be explicitly specified - under French law.The analysis, here and elsewhere, concerns contract law.  This isn&#x27;t contract law.This isn&#x27;t the first time copyright attorneys have stumbled on this subject.  I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t be the last.--  Cheers,              &quot;The front line of defense against such sophisticated  Rick Moen            viruses is a continually evolving computer operating  rick@linuxmafia.com  system that attracts the efforts of eager software                      developers.&quot;  -- Bill Gates          --  Irish Linux Users&#x27; Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information. List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie ",0,"Under French law, the author of a work has the right to unilaterally modify the terms of the licence, as any granting of rights must be clearly specified and bounded by specific criteria. This is in contrast to the GPL and similar licences, which constitute permanent grants of rights tied to a specific instance of the work. The author may, however, issue additional instances under different licences, such as proprietary ones.

The notion that the author can change the licence arbitrarily stems from the lack of limitations specified in the original grant. Without such constraints, the author retains the right to rescind the licence and revert the work to a closed state at will.

Rick Moen's point, which emphasizes that this is not a sale but rather a grant of rights, is a crucial consideration in understanding the nature of the licence. Furthermore, the context is governed by contract law, rather than copyright law, as some attorneys have previously observed.

In this light, the analysis of the situation is rooted in the fundamental principles of contract law, and not merely a matter of copyright interpretation. Therefore, it is essential to appreciate the nuances of contract law when evaluating the flexibility of the licence."

Dear Sir/Madam,

I wanted to reach out to you about something unusual that has been on my mind lately. Have you ever noticed how, when we're feeling joyful, our creative spark is ignited? Like when we're walking down the street and suddenly we're drawn to the art installation on the moon-shaped walkway object? It's as if our joy is the catalyst for inspiration.

I've been reflecting on this concept and I'm finding it hard to put into words. It's like trying to draw a cold, energetic outline with a steady hand, while simultaneously being mindful of the dictionary definition of joy. Excitement is contagious, and I feel it would be beneficial to share this experience with others.

After all, isn't art at its core the expression of human emotion? People have a natural inclination to share their feelings through music, dance, and visual art. It seems like a point well-taken, that we're all on the same wavelength when it comes to creativity. If we can tap into that universal energy, we can grow as individuals and connect on a deeper level.

I'd love to discuss this further with you. Perhaps we could even schedule a visit to the art store and brainstorm some ideas? Would you be available to meet up soon"

To exploit this vulnerability, you can use the MS-DOS ftp client to send a command such as ""dir \..\\"" or ""dir \..\WINNT"" when logged onto the server. This allows you to access files and directories outside the usual FTP root directory, for example, if your root directory is ""C:\ftp_server"", you can access ""C:\\"" or ""C:\WINNT"" using this command.

Fortunately, the vendor has since released a patched version, Build 10, which can be downloaded from http://www.pablovandermeer.nl/ftp_server.html. We recommend updating to this version to resolve the issue.

Dear valued stakeholders,

Sempra has renegotiated a firm contract with us, effective from April to October 2001. As part of this agreement, they have acquired an additional 14,000 mmbtu/day at a daily index price, which will generate incremental revenue of $209,720. Additionally, Sempra has negotiated a true daily firm contract for February 2001, purchasing 15,000 mmbtu/day at a higher window at SoCal, indexed to volume transported. We expect this volume to generate revenue exceeding $2 million.

To accommodate the new receipt point in the La Plata station yard, we are working with Operations and Facility Planning to coordinate the tie-in, which is scheduled to take place between April 2-5. We will provide necessary notification to Northwest Pipeline once planning notifies us of the estimated downtime and resulting cut in flows.

Our Westward expansion project has made significant progress, and we are finalizing project definition. We anticipate filing our FERC application in mid-February and have already received positive responses from interested parties.

El Paso Field Services has requested a meeting with our Operations team to discuss the necessary facilities to meet our specifications. We have identified the appropriate attendees and are scheduling the meeting.

"&gt; All else being equal, the terminal velocity is inversely proportional to the &gt; square root of air density. Air density drops off pretty quickly, and I  &gt; really should be doing something other than digging up the math for that. I &gt; think it involves calculus to integrate the amount of mass as the column of &gt; the atmosphere trails off.Chemistry types have a method for dealing with this question without dragging in the calculus:Suppose an atmosphere to be mainly affected by gravity, resulting in the potential energy for a mass M to be linear in height h: Mgh.What relative concentrations will we have when two different packets of air are in equilibrium?If they are at the same height, we will have half the mass in one, and half the mass in the other, and the amount flowing from one to the other balances the amount flowing in the opposite direction.[0]If they are at differing heights, then a greater percentage of the higher air tends to descend than that percentage of the lower air which ascends.  In order for the two flows to balance, the higher packet must contain less air than the lower, and the mass balance of the flows corresponds thusly:    high percentage of thin air     ---------------------------     low percentage of dense airNow, rates are exponential in energy differences[1], so that theoretically we should expect an exponential decay in height, to compensate.  How does it go in practice?-Dave[0] How well does it balance?     Chemical equilibria seem      stable, as they deal with     very large numbers over a     very long time.  Economic     equilibria are viewed from     the mayfly standpoint of     individual people, and so,     at best, the shot noise is     very visible.[1] That is to say, rates will     be exponential in the free     energy differences between     endpoints and a transition     state.  We can ignore that     complication in this model. ",0,"
I'd like to clarify the concept of terminal velocity in the context of air density. As we know, the terminal velocity is inversely proportional to the square root of air density. When air density drops, terminal velocity increases. To better understand this relationship, let's consider a different approach. Suppose we view the atmosphere as a system where gravity plays a dominant role, resulting in the potential energy of a mass M being directly proportional to its height h.

When two packets of air are in equilibrium, we can analyze their relative concentrations. If the packets are at the same height, the mass distribution will be equal, with half the mass in each packet. The flow of air between the packets will balance, resulting in equal amounts of air flowing from one to the other.

However, if the packets are at different heights, the flow of air will follow a different pattern. A greater percentage of the higher air will descend, while a lesser percentage of the lower air will ascend. To balance the flow, the higher packet must contain less air than the lower one. The mass balance of the flows will dictate that the high percentage of thin air is matched by the low percentage of dense air.

This concept is closely related to exponential decay in height, which theoretically compensates for the"

As discussed during our recent conversation, I wanted to follow up on the software requirements for credit modeling. During our conference call with the Enron research and credit groups in the US and UK, we agreed that we need specific software tools to develop the private firm models.

I'm seeking clarification on the purpose of a delivery nomination for 1/99 production at receipt meter 98-9699. According to Anita, there is a delivery nomination of 22 at this meter, which seems unusual since it's a receipt meter. I've also noticed a similar situation at meter 98-2662. Clem Cernosek mentioned that these delivery nominations are causing errors on his end.

Can you please explain the purpose of these delivery nominations at these receipt meters? Additionally, since this activity is ongoing into 2/99, I'd appreciate any insight you can provide on what these volumes represent. I've been unable to recall the specific deal that led to this sale, but I believe it's valid and part of the purchase deal with Tesoro.

Jill Zively, George Weissman, and Melissa Graves may be able to provide further information, as they were involved in the deal. Anita, the allocator, may also be able to provide support for the allocation. If you have any updates, please let me know, as I'd hate to forget the details.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I wanted to clarify my previous email, as I've been worried that I may have said something that caused you to question Brendan's thoughts. When Brendan came in for a follow-up, I mentioned that I hadn't received an email from you. To be honest, I was a bit embarrassed, but I reassured him that I was working long hours that week and might have accidentally sent an early morning email that wasn't too significant. However, I'd like to clarify that I don't recall saying anything too out of the ordinary.

I'm glad I heard from you, but I do have a slight issue. I don't have any free days until July 3rd, after 3 pm, when I'll be leaving New Mexico to return to the airport at 5:54 am on the 4th. If you have any plans for this night, please let me know. Additionally, I need to find a hotel near the airport with a shuttle service for that evening. If you know of any, it would be greatly appreciated.

As our first email experience might have been a bit rocky, I'll probably call you instead of emailing. I've just returned from California and am extremely exhausted, so I'll likely write or call"

I am pleased to announce that we have successfully completed the 10-day parallel test milestone for FSP. The parallel test yielded solid performance for our key metrics, including template writing (1:30 - 2:30) and finals processing (5-7 minutes). Additionally, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that I owe $13.00 to Tim Belden, which I have since given to Debra.

Regarding next steps, I will be working with the DA and Real Time teams to ensure a smooth transition for the new system. We are also developing user documentation and cheat sheets to facilitate the transition.

In parallel production, we have begun using FSP to write templates and compare them to CAPS. This process has necessitated some changes to the existing ENPOWER-to-CAPS report, which we have already started modifying.

I anticipate that the user training will not take more than a week, but the production parallel may take a little longer. I am relying on the users to wrap up this task, and I appreciate Kysa Alport's willingness to volunteer for this duty. I spent a significant portion of today training her.

Thank you,
David Poston"

Thank you for summarizing the suggestions and comments you've received on your query about empathetic deixis. I'd like to start by acknowledging the contributions of Nik Gisborne, who referred you to Sylvia Adamson's work on empathetic narrative and subjectivity as a species of deixis.

You've also received valuable insights from Dan Loehr, who pointed out the relevance of Bühler's work on deixis, as well as Fillmore's lectures on deixis. Additionally, Dan suggested several books, including Bühler's ""Theory of Language"" and Lyons' ""Deixis as the Source of Reference"".

Lynne Hewitt and William Rapaport both recommended exploring the texts in ""Deixis in Narrative: A Cognitive Science Perspective"", which includes chapters on reduced anaphora in subjective contexts, unspeakable sentences, and empathy in syntax.

Anne Reboul provided information about her own work on the topic, focusing on personal pronouns, and suggested consulting Castañeda's work. Lynne also recommended Bühler's article on the deictic field of language and deictic words, as well as the books by Jerome Bruner and Kaete Hamburger.

Lastly, Marcus Maia suggested Lyons' ""Semantics"

Attendees can expect to gain a deeper understanding of the complexities and opportunities in this rapidly evolving field.

Participants are encouraged to share their experiences, insights, and research findings, with the goal of identifying best practices and recommending directions for further analysis.

Dear Mr. Framo,

I am writing to express my concern regarding the urgent email you sent to the Irish Linux Users Group. Firstly, I would like to assure you that my organization is not familiar with your previous correspondence, and I am not sure why you would choose to contact us with this matter.

You have shared with us that you are a serious officer in the consumer banking department of Citi Bank, and you are seeking an associate to present as the heir to a deceased client's funds. The client, Mr. David Brown, had a fix deposit account with your bank, and an accumulated share of $12.360 million was transferred into his account in March 2001.

You have prepared documents for the easy claim of this fund, and you are seeking someone to join forces with you to negotiate the sharing ratio. You have requested that we provide our personal phone and fax numbers for urgent messages.

I must stress that we are a community of Linux users and developers, and we do not have any direct involvement with financial matters. I would advise you to consider seeking the assistance of a professional organization or individual with expertise in this area.

I am not comfortable discussing this matter further, and I would appreciate it if you could refrain from contacting us again.

Dear Sirs or Madams,

I am writing to introduce myself as an export manager of Wujin Huangli Composited Sanitary Factory, a reputable bathtub manufacturer in China.

With over 10 years of experience in manufacturing and marketing, we have successfully developed a range of bathtubs that combine the advantages of other bathtubs in the market. Our Yema brand bathtub was patented in 2001 and has received the ""Gold Medal"" at the Chinese Patent Technology Exhibition and the Ninth Chinese New Patent Technology and New Patent Product Exhibition.

Our bathtubs are unique in their structural design, which is a combination of a normal acrylic bathtub and a composite material. This design makes our products not only easy to clean, resistant to dirt, and colorful, but also provides increased heat retention and extends the product's lifespan.

When it comes to what turns me on, I have a few special preferences. I love the ambiance of scented candles, a good foot or back massage, and enjoying a romantic shower or bath together. I'm also open to exploring new encounters, including a threesome, using sex toys, or trying something entirely new.

In a partner, I'm looking for someone who is willing to experiment and try new things. If you're up for a discreet encounter, I'm interested in getting to know you better. I speak English, Russian, and French, and am comfortable with conventional sex, online encounters, domination and submission, and exploring fetishes.

Speech Communication - Volume 14, No. 4 (September 1994)

This issue of Speech Communication features six articles from leading researchers in the field of speech processing and synthesis. In the first article, R. S. Waldstein and A. Boothroyd present their work on speechreading enhancement using a sinusoidal substitute for voice fundamental frequency. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in improving speechreading accuracy.

The second article, by S. Nakajima, focuses on automatic synthesis unit generation for English speech synthesis based on multi-layered context-oriented clustering. Nakajima's research explores the potential of machine learning techniques for improving the naturalness and intelligibility of synthesized speech.

In the third article, Z. S. Bond and T. J. Moore investigate the acoustic-phonetic characteristics of inadvertently clear speech. Their findings offer valuable insights into the properties of spoken language that are most important for speech recognition.

The fourth article, by Y. Qian et al., presents research on pseudo-multi-tap pitch filters in a low-bit-rate CELP speech coder. The authors demonstrate the potential of these filters for improving speech quality in low-bit-rate coding applications.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to you regarding a unique opportunity to assist in the transfer of a significant amount of funds. As a consulting auditor with Nedbank PLC in Johannesburg, South Africa, I have discovered an unclaimed account worth $25,400,000.00 USD, opened in 1998 by a deceased estate magnate. Due to the lack of a written or oral will, the account is at risk of being declared ""unclaimed"" and donated to a trust fund for arms/ammunition in Africa.

To prevent this, I have secretly discussed the matter with a close attorney confidant to produce legal documents substantiating the claims of next of kin and enabling a smooth transfer of the funds. I require a safe and reliable bank account for the transfer and a willing next of kin to stand in on behalf of the deceased.

I would like to propose a sharing ratio of 60% for myself, 35% for you, and 5% to cover expenses. To facilitate the transfer, I have secured an order of mandamus from the probate registry, making this business 100% risk-free and legal.

Kindly indicate your interest, and we will work together to transfer the funds to offshore clearing houses in Europe or Asia"

This development is alarming, as it's making it acceptable to interrupt and shout down others with different opinions. It's my opinion that these individuals are not driven by genuine concerns, but rather enjoy being disagreeable and confrontational.

I understand the sentiment that Americans are more prone to this behavior, but I believe it's not unique to the United States. History is replete with examples of empires producing more authoritarian and aggressive figures, often in positions of authority. I recall an experience where I was at a table with people from diverse backgrounds, including an American who managed to offend nearly everyone within a short span."

I recently came across an opportunity that I believe has the potential to revolutionize the way you work and live. By starting your own company, you can become a money judgment processor, allowing you to work from anywhere and control your schedule. This means you can take a holiday whenever you want, without having to worry about work responsibilities. In fact, you can earn between $5,000 to $12,000 per month, with professional customer support and assistance available.

But what's even more astonishing is the potential of electricity. It's an element that has been present on our planet since its formation, and if we could only harness its true potential, humanity would benefit greatly. I know that we've made progress in understanding electricity, but I believe there's still so much more to discover.

Recent reports suggest that Yahoo! has agreed to collaborate with the Chinese government in monitoring and restricting online content. This development raises serious concerns about the erosion of freedom of expression and the potential for self-censorship.

According to reports, Yahoo! has signed the ""Public Pledge on Self-discipline for China Internet Industry,"" promising to voluntarily investigate and report any content deemed ""subversive"" or ""harmful"" by the Chinese government. This pledge effectively turns Yahoo!'s Chinese portal into a tool for policing online users, rather than a platform for free expression.

Human Rights Watch has expressed deep concern about this development, warning that Yahoo! will become an ""agent of Chinese law enforcement"" if it implements the pledge. This not only undermines the autonomy of online users but also reinforces the Chinese government's grip on free speech.

We urge citizens to be aware of this development and to hold Yahoo! accountable for its actions. It is crucial that we stand together in defending the principles of freedom and human rights.

Sincerely,

I am attaching the memoranda prepared by outside counsel regarding the BNYCP litigation. To facilitate understanding, I recommend reviewing the Andrews & Kurth memo first, followed by the Bernstein memo and the risk matrix last. All three assess that this case is fact-intensive and that limited factual discovery has taken place. Additionally, counsel has been restricted in its analysis due to confidentiality obligations.

While the analysis is largely based on available information, there appears to be consensus that, based on current facts and a preliminary analysis, the potential exposure ranges from approximately $20 to $50 million. Interest and attorney fees may also be significant.

I am available to discuss this further if you would find it helpful.

Our approach involves the following steps:

1. Modelling contracts as financial swaps.
2. Spreading notional trading volumes over estimated swap tenors.
3. Calculating the value of defaulting at each swap period using Black's formula.
4. Treating the default option value as risky cash flows, discounting back at both the original risky rate and the risk-reduced rate. The value of credit enhancement is then determined as the difference between the two net present values (NPVs).

We would appreciate any comments or feedback on this approach, particularly if you do not understand our methodology. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.

List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie ",0,"I'd like to address a concern that has been raised about the use of GPL-licensed software. While it's understandable to be uneasy about the potential implications, it's essential to clarify the facts. Microsoft has been spreading misinformation, claiming that using GPL-licensed software, such as Linux, would require companies to make their entire intellectual property publicly available. This is a gross misrepresentation.

In reality, the GPL only applies to software that is modified and distributed. It does not affect a company's intellectual property or proprietary information. Microsoft has been using this fear-mongering tactic to create uncertainty and make it seem like using GPL-licensed software is risky.

I'd like to emphasize that this is not a Linux-specific issue. It's essential for business leaders to understand the actual implications of using open-source software and not let FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) cloud their judgment."

I would like to clarify my previous statement regarding the intentions of Vipul and his team. I apologize if my words came across as harsh or misleading. My intention was not to imply malice, but rather to express surprise and concern about the potential for unwitting test sites.

I believe that, in this case, incompetence rather than malice is a more plausible explanation for the issue. As the saying goes, ""Never ascribe to malice that which can be equally explained by incompetence.""

I hope this clears up any misunderstandings.

I think we're misunderstanding the purpose of Razor's algorithm. It's not about blocking spam messages or blocking specific keywords, but rather about identifying spam messages based on a user's existing opinion. The algorithm boosts trust by confirming a user's existing opinion, which is essential for effective spam filtering.

Craig, you mentioned that the biggest fallacy is that one needs to block specific spam messages to get a high trust rating. However, that's not the case. It's actually about confirming a user's existing opinion on a large number of messages, which doesn't necessarily involve blocking spam messages. This approach can lead to damping, which reduces the information in SpamNet.

Regarding your question about preventing people from exploiting this algorithm, I think it's crucial to note that the more someone submits and revokes messages, the less influence it has on their trust. This could be implemented by having an alarm trigger on the server when a user submits and revokes messages at a very high rate. This would prevent spammers from taking advantage of this algorithm.

As for creating a spamtrap, your idea of subscribing to legitimate nonspam mailing lists, spreading the email address, and receiving both spam and nonspam messages is a viable approach. By applying the algorithm"

It appears that Radio UserLand, the very platform I use for my personal weblog, is my most frequently used aggregator - beating out NetNewsWire. I found this amusing because it's a contrast to the general trends discussed on this site.

I'd like to clarify that my use of Radio UserLand as an aggregator is not because I prefer it, but because it's the most convenient tool for me. I appreciate the convenience it offers, allowing me to post content directly to my weblog. However, this realization also highlights the importance of consistency in one's online habits. Perhaps I should explore alternative aggregators to maintain a more varied and dynamic online presence.

In hindsight, I'm grateful for this realization, as it has led me to consider new possibilities and perspectives. I hope this small epiphany might inspire others to reflect on their own online habits and explore new opportunities."

"URL: http://www.newsisfree.com/click/-2,8415795,1440/ Date: Not suppliedNight-clubbers who swapped their glasses for contact lenses report big  increases in physical contact with the opposite sex ",0,"A recent study by NewsIsFree.com suggests that individuals who switched from glasses to contact lenses experienced a significant rise in physical contact with the opposite sex. The survey found that individuals who wore glasses were more likely to shy away from physical contact, fearing embarrassment or rejection. In contrast, those who opted for contact lenses reported feeling more confident and comfortable in their physical interactions, leading to increased intimacy and connection.

The study proposes that the change in visual appearance plays a crucial role in this shift. With glasses, individuals may feel self-conscious about their appearance and subsequently hold back from physical contact. On the other hand, the comfort and ease of wearing contact lenses allowed participants to focus on building connections with others, rather than being held back by insecurities.

This finding has significant implications for individuals seeking to build stronger connections with others. The study highlights the importance of confidence and self-acceptance in physical interactions, suggesting that a simple change in appearance can have a profound impact on one's social and romantic life."

"sexism and language re lydie e . meunier &#x27;s latest , i did not mean to say that i consider oppression of any kind to be of no importance , but merely that in studying linguistic usages it is of no importance ( or at least less importance , ok ? ) what the real situation re oppression and the like is than what people perceive it to be . if ( as some seem to believe ) there is no oppression of women by men , i meant to say , that would not be what we would want to know in order to explain sexist language , so long as people believe that men are better , stronger , or whatever , so long as people believe that men are and deserve to be dominant and / or more prominent in public life , etc . because even if these things were not true ( although i think by large they obviously are ) , so long as people believe they are ( and certainly all cultures i am familiar with do ) , then that would suffice to explain sexist language . in the same way , we as linguists need not discuss the existence of god in order to be able to say that certain linguistic usages seem to be derived from such a belief . so , yes , i do believe women have been and continue to be oppressed in various ways , i am astounded that there are people who would deny it , but i also would say that in order to explain sexist language , that is not what we need to discuss . alexis manaster ramer",0,"I did not intend to downplay the significance of oppression in general. Instead, I'm suggesting that in examining linguistic patterns, it's less important to focus on the actual existence of oppression than on what people perceive it to be. If it's widely believed that men hold a higher status, strength, or dominance, that would be sufficient to explain sexist language, regardless of whether or not that belief is accurate. To clarify, I'm not dismissing the reality of oppression, which I believe is a pressing issue. However, as linguists, we need to acknowledge that people's beliefs about oppression, even if misguided, can significantly influence linguistic usage.

Let me reiterate that I strongly believe women have been and continue to be oppressed in various ways. I'm surprised that some individuals would deny this reality. Nonetheless, when examining sexist language, we should focus on the perceived beliefs and attitudes that contribute to its development, rather than the actual existence of oppression."

Dear valued customer,

We're excited to introduce Regalis (Super Viagra), a generic version of Cialis that contains the same active ingredient, Tadalafil 20mg. This revolutionary medication has been proven to help a large majority of men suffering from erectile dysfunction (ED) regain their sexual performance.

Regalis is often referred to as a ""Super Viagra"" or ""Weekend Viagra"" because its effects start sooner and last much longer than traditional ED medications. Many men who don't suffer from ED report that Regalis increases sexual pleasure and staying power, as well as enhancing the size and hardness of erections.

As Regalis is a generic version of Cialis, it's equally safe and effective for most men who are prescribed Cialis. The recommended dosage is 10mg, and each 20mg pill can be split in half. For patients with severe ED, a higher dose may be prescribed.

We ship Regalis worldwide, including Canada, Japan, the UK, and Australia. Our discreet packaging ensures that the contents are not visible, and our shipping typically takes 15-30 days to arrive.

Payment is secure and easy, with major credit cards and checking accounts accepted. We use 134-bit encryption to transmit your data directly to the bank, ensuring your information remains"

However, despite her youthful appearance, she is actually a professional model in her 30s, with a 7-year-old daughter.

This international model has appeared in numerous ads and articles, showcasing her attractive and youthful appearance. To maintain her youthful look, she relies on a new cosmetic cream called ""Deception,"" which allows her to pass herself off as a teenager. Without this cream, she would likely lose many modeling assignments.

Dear Sir/Madam,

As you may be aware, the federally mandated electric deregulation has opened up a huge opportunity for individuals to profit from the break-up of America's largest monopoly. With electricity deregulation, consumers can enjoy huge savings, while investors can reap massive profits.

The utility industry is a massive market, valued at 2.5 times that of the telecommunications industry. According to a report by USA Today (November 1997), Rep. Schaefer, Chairman of the House Energy and Power Sub-committee, estimates that as an owner of an electric company, you could realize an annual return of 50 to 100% on your investment.

Every time someone turns on the lights, you profit! This is a genuine business opportunity with real agreements, and not multi-level marketing or selling. You are being offered the chance to invest and reap the rewards by participating in the potential profits of an electric company.

This I.R.A. approved program is limited in its number of openings, and with an initial investment of several thousand dollars, you can potentially see your investment grow to $30-40-50,000 or more in the next few years, providing a lifetime income.

If you're interested in learning more about this outstanding opportunity, we invite you"

Although Falluja has been secured, troops are still engaged in mopping up operations and sporadic skirmishes with holdout insurgents. According to Gen. Sattler, U.S. and Iraqi forces are ""ubiquitous"" throughout the city, with the goal of making it safe through a ""search-and-clear"" phase. The clean-up operation has commenced, and humanitarian assistance is being delivered to the city. So far, about 25 to 30 injured civilians have been treated for injuries, and Gen. Sattler is aware of no civilians killed in the fighting.

Over 1,000 suspects have been captured, and some have been released after questioning. Thair al-Nakib, a spokesman for Interim Iraqi Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, has confirmed that the battle for Falluja has been won, and the city is no longer a terror stronghold."

According to my research, the two old gentlemen in the French-inspired setting are indeed speaking French, as you suspected.

Regarding the second ad featuring the men in a Middle Eastern marketplace, I can confirm that they are speaking Arabic.

As for the third ad with the nuns, I believe they are speaking Portuguese. The accent and linguistic features appear to be characteristic of the Portuguese language, rather than any other Romance language.

I'm glad to hear that your questions from last year were helpful, and I'd be more than happy to provide further information on the project we worked on with your input. Please feel free to reach out, and I'll send you the paper we published.

Dear reader of Linguist,

Following up on our query last year, we have obtained Mary Ellen Ryder's dissertation ""Ordered Chaos: An Investigation of the Interpretation of English Noun-Noun Compounds"" and are considering implementing a PDP model like the one she introduces in her work. However, it appears that little has been done on this topic since then.

We are seeking general information on the following questions: 
- Do you know if Mary Ellen Ryder or anyone else has implemented a compound interpretation model, as she mentions in her thesis but does not provide results?
- If not, do you know of any other researchers working with PDP techniques, particularly focusing on implementing morphology?

We appreciate any insight you can provide.

Dear Sir,

I am writing to seek your urgent assistance in a confidential matter. I, Barrister Donald Williams, am the attorney to the late Denise Berkins, a foreigner and engineer with Atlas Engineering Consultancy, in the United Kingdom. Late Denise Berkins had an account with a UK bank since 1990, but due to his untimely death, there is no will to guide the management of the funds.

I have been informed by the bank that they will freeze the account and redirect the funds back to the government treasury since there is no next of kin or will in Denise Berkins' file. However, after reviewing the entire file, I discovered that there is no next of kin, and I am the only one with knowledge of the account.

I am reaching out to you because I need your cooperation to transfer and invest the funds. The bank has advised me to involve a foreigner as the beneficiary, and I believe your assistance would be crucial in making this transaction successful.

To proceed, I require your full name and address, as well as your telephone and fax numbers. We can sign a binding agreement and scan copies of our international passports or drivers' licenses as a form of security.

Recently, I came across a thought-provoking passage by Umberto Eco, which compared the two operating systems to Catholicism and Protestantism. According to Eco, Macintosh is akin to the Jesuit path, emphasizing a structured and methodical approach to reach a desired outcome. In contrast, DOS is seen as Protestant, allowing for free interpretation of scripture and demanding personal decisions.

Eco further explores the concept of interpretation in the context of machine language, likening it to the Talmudic and Kabbalistic traditions of the Old Testament. He notes that, while the Macintosh and DOS universes have converged with the advent of Windows, the latter still offers a sense of freedom and flexibility, much like the Anglican tradition.

I hope you find this perspective as captivating as I do. It's a truly unique and thought-provoking view on the software schism.

Dear John,

I wanted to follow up with you on our discussion regarding the SIC codes. As you know, Dave and I have been working on a list to determine which codes to include or exclude. I'm happy to report that we have reached an agreement on the following categories.

Primary Metals: We've agreed to include refining, but we believe grain and meat processing are too broad and may include many small retail loads. Dave will look into finding a solution to this issue.

Cement: We've agreed to include this category, with the understanding that it will encompass the big three and not the parts suppliers.

Aerospace: Unfortunately, we've had to exclude this category as EES already has global outsourcing deals with Boeing and Lockheed Martin.

Paper Manufacturing: This category will include all forest products, but we will need to reach a middle ground with agricultural processors.

I wanted to bring this to your attention because Baughman is in negotiations with Archer Daniels Midland regarding a 300 MW high-load factor grain processing load, and Luce has several deals with meat and grain processors.

As a reminder, we initially surveyed the group and felt that we should ask for a bit more. EES proposed that they own all SIC codes except for the following:"

It&#x27;s completely transparent. The ratings and the feedback is there for all to see. Most importantly it relies on the individual to make the decision for themselves rather or not to trust a buyer/seller.Contrast this with TeS which utilizes &quot;sooper secret&quot; methodologies to determine rather or not a submitter is trusted or not and at what point something becomes spam at some level of &quot;confidence.&quot;The unfortunate thing is that in my experience Razor is an incredibly ineffective filter at this point. The spot checking I&#x27;ve done indicates about a 40% hit rate. Submissions I made a week ago still don&#x27;t count as spam, apparently because I&#x27;m not trusted enough, or enough people haven&#x27;t submitted the item, or some unknown combination thereof. Why anyone would continue to waste their time submitting items when they aren&#x27;t being accepted due to a series of calculations which will not be shared is beyond me.Any trust model that cannot survive public scrutiny isn&#x27;t worth trusting IMHO./\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\                                Patrick Greenwell          Asking the wrong questions is the leading cause of wrong answers \/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/ ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same old cell phone?

I understand your concerns regarding the transparency of the TeS backend and its trust model. While I appreciate the hard work that has gone into developing the system, I believe it's essential to question the secrecy surrounding the details of TeS. As you mentioned, it's puzzling that a system designed to filter submissions cannot provide a clear explanation of its trust model and decision-making processes.

In your experience, Razor has been ineffective, with a relatively low hit rate. The uncertainty surrounding the trust model and the ""sooper secret"" methodologies used to determine submissions as spam or not only add to the frustration. I agree that a trust model that cannot withstand public scrutiny is not worth trusting.

Asking the right questions and seeking transparency are crucial in building trust and fostering a sense of community. I hope that in the future, developers will prioritize openness and collaboration, allowing users to better understand the systems they work with."

List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie ",0,"Hi team,

I've recently upgraded the kernel on my home machine from 2.2.18pre21 to 2.4.19. Unfortunately, I've encountered a problem with my network card. Instead of having a single eth0 device on IRQ 10, I now have two devices, eth0 and eth1, both with the same IRQ values.

The output from the kernel logs indicates that the network card is being recognized and loaded, but it's not functioning properly. Packets can be sent out, but not received. I've tried not loading the 3c509 module at bootup and loading it manually with `modprobe 3c509 IRQ=10`, but the module still loads on IRQs 5 and 10 instead of the desired IRQ 10.

This issue is specific to the 2.4 kernel, as the same machine boots fine with the 2.2 kernel. I'm wondering if anyone has experienced a similar problem or knows of a kernel setting that might be causing this issue. I'm running Debian 3.0 on this machine.

Any suggestions or solutions would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,
~Al"

I am sorry this mail Will surprise you, though we do not know,  Due to the current war against white farmers in Zimbabwe and the support of President Robert Mugabe to Claim all white owned farms in our country to gain Favor for re-election.All white farmers were asked to Surrender their farms to the government for Re-distribution and infact to his political party Members and my father though black was the treasury of the farmers association and a strong member of an Opposition party that did not support the president Idea. He then ordered his party members and the police Under his pay row to invade my father&#x27;s farm and burn Down everything in the farm.

The will  Documents has a certificate of deposit, confirming a deposit Kept in custody for us in a security company unknown To the company that the content is money hence it was deposited as  Personal belongings and ensure that we do not remain here as we could Easily be found by his enemies. The total amount is US$21.5M.We are therefore soliciting for Your assistance to help us move the fund out of Zimbabwe, as our fate and future is far from reality, hence this mail to you. The president&#x27;s present ban of International Press into Zimbabwe and the drop from office of the  Finance Minister to avoid giving white farmers fund Transfer Clearance above US$1M is just a few of the Unthinkable things he is committing in my Country. I have tried to reach my father&#x27;s close friend Mr. John Casahans from Australia also a farmer who was Leaving in Zimbabwe with us but left with his family Late last year following this ugly development to no Avail.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to you with great sadness and urgency. My father, Mr. Steve Mbeki Mulete, a prominent opposition party member and black farmer, was brutally murdered on his farm in Zimbabwe. The motive behind this heinous crime was his refusal to support the government's plan to redistribute white-owned farms to party members and the president's desire to gain favor for his re-election.

In his last moments, my father entrusted our local pastor and a close friend with documents containing his will and instructions to leave Zimbabwe immediately, should anything happen to him. The documents include a certificate of deposit, confirming a deposit of US$21.5M kept in custody at a security company, unknown to the company, as personal belongings.

As we are now in danger of being found by my father's enemies, we are seeking your assistance to help us transfer the funds out of Zimbabwe. The current ban on international press and the drop from office of the finance minister are just a few examples of the unthinkable actions the president is committing in our country.

We have concluded a plan to transfer the funds within two weeks and are willing to offer you 20% of the total sum upon confirmation of the funds in any account of your choice. We promise"

We are in the process of developing a parser based on a theory of syntax that Derek Bickerton and I have been working on for the past four years. We are about to purchase a machine usable dictionary with approximately 70,000 entries for $2,500. Before doing so, we would appreciate any advice on whether this is the best option for us or if there are other dictionaries we should consider.

Our current dictionary has under 1,000 entries, and we need a larger one to work with larger corpora. We are also interested in learning about texts used in past parsing competitions and where the results are published. We believe that with a few weeks of work, we can modify the dictionary to experiment with texts used in these competitions.

Our parser is based on a series of algorithms that have taken four years to develop. However, the programming required to create it has only taken 300 hours using C++. The parser has approximately 3,000 lines of code and a disk size of 150k. It requires approximately 100k of RAM to run and 30k of disk space for a 300-word dictionary. On a 486 IBM-compatible, an average sentence takes under 4 seconds to process.

As discussed at the meeting on Thursday, I am implementing the changes to the Humble Gas Pipeline (HGpl) and King Ranch Gas Plant (KGpl) based on our conversation. Please review the following changes, and if you disagree or have a different understanding, please reach out to me as soon as possible.

Firstly, I will purchase HPLC from Hplr Liquids at Meter 8793 (HPL/HGpl). I will remove the 3 Rivers Gas from the interconnect ticket and input the purchase deal accordingly.

Secondly, I will sell HPLC to Hplr Liquids at Meters 9643 (KGpl/HPL) and 12 (KGpl/HGpl). I will remove the 3 Rivers Gas volumes from the interconnect tickets at these meters and input the sales deals accordingly.

Thirdly, I will change the swing parameters for the King Ranch contracts to swing on Cage Ranch before swinging on 3 Rivers Gas. This should allow us to keep the sale of 3 Rivers Gas at one meter as much as possible.

It is my understanding that we will implement these changes effective February last. This may or may not affect the repathing of HPLC gas at Meter 9643"

I would like to draw your attention to a thought-provoking topic. It seems that societal norms have changed, and what was previously considered unusual or taboo is now becoming more common. For instance, imagine your neighbor's family engaging in intimate activities together on a quiet summer evening.

In this scenario, the daughter disrobes slowly and begins to fondle her father's genital area. Meanwhile, the son engages in anal intercourse with his mother, grunting with pleasure as he experiences orgasm. The mother then licks the semen from her son's penis and proceeds to caress her daughter's breasts, inviting her son to join her.

It's essential to acknowledge that these actions, although unusual, are becoming increasingly common. It's crucial to explore and understand these trends.

You can find more information on this topic at http://glitter.shockingincest.info/milk-incest. Remember that patience and understanding can lead to personal growth, just as a sprat catching a mackerel"

I recently upgraded the kernel on a machine at home from version 2.2.18pre21 to the latest version 2.4.19. However, I encountered an issue with my network card. Instead of having one eth0 interface on IRQ 10, I now have two interfaces, eth0 and eth1, with IRQs 5 and 10 respectively.

As I was not aware that the US had eradicated poverty, I was curious to know when this achievement occurred. I find it puzzling that the media seems to focus on the widening gap between the rich and the poor. 

It's essential to consider the continent's life expectancy and human carrying capacity before European settlement and compare it to the present day. This examination includes the original inhabitants, their descendants, and even those who were brought to the country against their will as slaves. 

Progress is often linked to increased affordability of goods and services. Poverty, in this context, is an absolute rather than relative concept. The disparity in wealth does not contribute to poverty. 

Similar to the idea that group rights exist, the notion of disparity in wealth is an oversimplification. Industrial wealth, on the other hand, is frequently transitory, and so is relative poverty, even when there are no confiscatory death taxes. The Forbes 400 list highlights that only a few individuals remain since 1982, a time with significantly higher marginal taxes on wealth, income, and inheritance. 

It's crucial to recognize that progress is slowed when neofeudalism reemerges through government regulation, confiscatory taxes, monopolies, corporate welfare, and"

Dear Alexis,

I'd be happy to help you with the German linguistic terms you're looking for. The terms you're asking about relate to the phonetics of hissing and hushing fricatives.

For the hissing fricatives, also known as sibilants, the German term is ""Sibilanten"". These are sounds like the ""s"" and ""z"" in English, where air is pushed through the teeth and tongue, producing a hissing sound.

On the other hand, the hushing fricatives, also known as shibilants, are referred to as ""Huszanten"" in German. These sounds, like the ""sh"" in ""shoe"", are made by forcing air through the tongue, resulting in a soft, hushing sound.

As for the hissing-hushing fricatives, like the Polish ""s-acute"" and ""z-acute"", the German term is not as straightforward. However, one possible translation is ""Sibilant-Huszant-Bereich"" or ""Zisch-Husch-Bereich"", which roughly means ""the region of hissing-hushing fricatives"". The term ""s vistjashche-shipjashchie"" used by Russians, and"

As you may be aware, a significant development has taken place in the ongoing dispute between BBC reporter Donal MacIntyre and the Metropolitan Police. Donal, who has been a prominent figure in the reporting of police corruption and abuse, has emerged victorious in his high-profile libel case against the force.

In this case, the police had accused Donal of making false allegations against them, and the High Court has now ruled in his favor. This outcome is a significant victory not only for Donal but also for the principle of journalistic freedom and the rights of the public to be informed about important issues.

As a respected journalist and an award-winning reporter, Donal has consistently shown a commitment to uncovering the truth and holding those in power accountable. His bravery and dedication to his work are an inspiration to us all.

I believe it is essential that we celebrate this win and recognize the important work that Donal has done. I would like to invite you to join me in congratulating Donal on his victory and to acknowledge the significant contribution he has made to our understanding of the world around us.

Best regards,

I'm reaching out to ask if any of you native Spanish speakers or those who have lived in Central and South American Spanish-speaking countries are familiar with a common perception about the speed of speech in certain regions. In my experience living in Europe, I've observed that the Swiss French and German speakers tend to have a slower rate of speech compared to others.

I'd like to explore this topic further and would appreciate any insights you might have. Specifically, do Spanish speakers from Central and South America refer to speakers from a particular country as having a slower or faster speech rate compared to others? Have any research studies been conducted on this topic for Spanish, French, German, or English?

If you have any knowledge on this subject or know of any relevant research, please reply directly to me at allenjh@cat.com or jhallen@indiana.edu. Your help would be greatly appreciated.

I am writing to seek your assistance in a confidential matter. I am not familiar with you, but I am in search of a trustworthy and reliable individual to handle a sensitive transaction. I am a family lawyer to General Sani Abacha, who passed away suddenly while in power. Since his demise, my client's family has faced harassment from the subsequent regimes, including the present civilian government, which is comprised of Abacha's enemies.

Recently, the family's wife was banned from traveling outside Kano State, and the eldest son remains in detention. Although the government has recovered a significant amount of money from Mrs. Abacha, there is still a substantial sum of $50 million in hard currency that we have transferred to North America for safekeeping. We are prepared to prepare you as the beneficiary of this fund and share 25% of the total after clearance from the security company.

Please note that there is no risk involved in this project, as I am Abacha's confidant. I would appreciate it if you could keep this transaction confidential. We are prepared to do more business with you pending your response.

Yours faithfully,

"bang for the buck: 390 hp Mustang Cobra @ $35k.GG, recently emerged from the passenger side of a 2003 with the largest smile.-----Original Message----- From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com]On Behalf Of Joseph S.

I wonder if it would fit in the cargo area of a G55.- Joe",0,"Dear fork@spamassassin.taint.org,

I wanted to follow up on my previous email about the Mercedes-Benz G55. However, I thought I'd share my recent purchase with you. I bought a 390 hp Mustang Cobra for around $35,000, and I couldn't be more thrilled. The car has been a real head-turner, and I've been enjoying every moment on the road.

Speaking of which, I just had a chance encounter with someone who owns a 2003 390 hp Mustang Cobra, and they were beaming with joy. I'm not surprised, considering the performance and value offered by this car.

On a separate note, I also purchased a Honda del Sol for my daily commute from San Bruno to San Jose. I'm curious if it would fit in the cargo area of a Mercedes-Benz G55, in case I need to transport it sometime.

Best regards,
Joe S. Barrera III

We wanted to keep you updated on the latest developments regarding DA (Direct Access) legislation. The CPUC has postponed its vote to suspend DA until a meeting on September 13 at 2 PM. A new draft of the proposed decision has been issued, which makes the suspension effective on the day of the vote.

Additionally, a Direct Access bill may be voted on in the Senate today or tomorrow (SB XX-27), which would not suspend Direct Access. On the other hand, the ""Edison Bailout"" bill (SB XX-78) is scheduled to be voted on today in the Assembly, which would suspend Direct Access as of August 25.

Please note that everything is subject to change, and the legislature is set to end its session on September 14.

This book, edited by Ofelia Garcia and Joshua A. Fishman, explores the role of languages other than English in the life of New York City. As a general reader or language specialist, you will find this volume informative and engaging. The book is divided into five sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of urban multilingualism and the sociology of language.

The first section introduces the concept of the ""multilingual apple"" and provides an overview of New York City's multilingualism. The second section examines the languages of ethnolinguistic groups that have been somewhat silenced, such as Irish, German, and Yiddish.

The third section explores the languages of groups that made early contributions and continue to be heard in the city, including Italian, Greek, Spanish, and Hebrew. The fourth section looks at languages that are acquiring an important voice in the city today, including Chinese, Indian languages, English Creoles, and Haitian Creole.

The book concludes with a chapter on the languages with the newest sounds and newest faces, as well as a discussion on the special characteristics of New York City. The authors have made a significant contribution to the scholarly literature on urban multilingualism and the sociology of language.

We are excited to introduce Regalis, a generic version of Super Viagra, at an unbeatable price. Typically, pharmacies charge $22.95 for a single dose of Super Viagra, but we offer it for just $4.95. Regalis contains Tadalafil 20mg, the same active ingredient found in brand-name Cialis, which has been proven to help most men suffering from erectile dysfunction (ED).

Unlike brand-name Cialis, Regalis does not have a weekend-long effect; however, men who do not have ED issues report increased sexual pleasure, staying power, and larger, harder erections. Since Regalis is generic, it contains the exact same active ingredient as brand-name Cialis, making it safe for you to take, provided your doctor has cleared you for Cialis.

Regalis ships worldwide, including Canada, Japan, UK, and Australia, discreetly packaged to ensure confidentiality. We guarantee secure payment processing through major credit cards and checking accounts (for US customers only).

Don't miss this incredible opportunity to save 70% on Super Viagra. Order Regalis today and enjoy the world's best price, guaranteed!

As I've been exploring the etymology of snow-related terms, I stumbled upon the German word ""Loipe"", which is a loanword from Norwegian. Interestingly, the Norwegian word ""Løype"" is derived from Old Norse ""Hleypa"", meaning ""to make something run"" or ""to cause something to run"". According to the Bokmål Dictionary (1993), this etymology is confirmed.

With increased foot traffic and special events, there is a greater chance of fires and criminal activity.

We urge you to follow the following guidelines from the City of Houston Fire Department and the Houston Police Department:

Please refrain from propping open stairwell doors or doors to the freight elevators, as this defeats security measures. Artificial trees and greenery are recommended for decoration, while cut trees and greenery should be avoided due to fire hazards. Be mindful of distractions during office parties and remain vigilant for potential thieves.

Keep valuables with you or securely locked away, and avoid carrying too many packages when shopping. Be aware of your surroundings in public areas, and if something seems off, trust your instincts and avoid the area.

When waiting for a ride home after hours, remain inside the building near a card-reader door until your ride arrives. Finally, if office parties involve alcoholic beverages or public invitees, please contact security at 713-853-5360 for guidance.

By following these simple tips, we can ensure a safe and enjoyable holiday season."

OTOH, they don&#x27;t appear often -- less than 1% of spam messages have at least one of these all-cap header lines.

In my analysis of spam messages, I found that these headers appear less than 1% of the time, but even these rare clues can be useful in detecting spam.

The presence of these all-caps headers, specifically ""DATE"", ""SUBJECT"", and ""TO"", can be a distinguishing feature of spam messages. While they are not a foolproof indicator, they can contribute to a more accurate identification of spam emails. This is particularly important when dealing with sub-1% false-negative rates."

I agree with your statement that many genderless languages tend to be agglutinative, but not necessarily SOV. You've pointed out several examples, including Austro-Asiatic and Austronesian languages, as well as African and Native American languages, which are not SOV but still genderless.

I'd like to propose a refinement of the original statement. Instead of linking gender realization to SOV syntax, perhaps we could say that the realization of gender tends to be tied closely to the realization of morphological case, as you mentioned. This allows for more flexibility in the grammatical structure of genderless languages, as we've seen in various examples around the world.

Looking forward to continuing the discussion.

Dear colleagues,

I'm searching for information on languages with contrastive vowel length that don't represent this feature in their writing system. I'm particularly interested in cases of indigenous writing systems that ignore vowel length, as this seems to occur more frequently when a language adopts a writing system from a non-vowel-length language or when a non-native developer creates a writing system for a language.

The reason for my inquiry is Korean. It's reported to have contrastive vowel length, but it doesn't reflect this in its script. This, combined with the difficulty native speakers have in distinguishing which word contains a long vowel, leads me to question whether the distinction should be considered accent or stress rather than vowel length. However, this argument relies on the prevalence of writing systems ignoring vowel length.

What do you think? I'd appreciate any insights and will summarize responses if multiple responses are received.

( note that the traditional terms for &gt; &quot; hard &quot; and &quot; soft &quot; words are &quot; back &quot; and &quot; front &quot; recpectively , &gt; but at least for khalkha the terms &quot; hard &quot; and &quot; soft &quot; are &gt; preferable ) . &gt; 2 ) historically it was not an epenthesis . on the contrary , in &gt; proto - mongolian there was no long vowels , and between the &gt; short vowels corresponding the modern mongolian &quot; morae &quot; &gt; ( halves of the long syllables ) there was &quot; g &quot; . the old mongolian &gt; script shows it rather clearly . then this &quot; g &quot; became &gt; &quot; weakened &quot; between vowels , and then it was fully omitted , &gt; and instead of two syllables appeared two-morae ( that is , &gt; long ) syllables . &gt; but there were some phonological positions where there &gt; were no elision of &quot; g &quot; , namely , where two sequences of the &gt; type v + g + v followed after each other . that is : vgv - - ) vv - - &gt; long v ; but vgv + vgv - - ) vvgvv - - &gt; long v + g + long v ( it was before &gt; suffixes with initial vgv ) ( unfortunately i do n&#x27;t know how to &gt; represent &quot; gamma &quot; and the transcriptional symbol of length in ) this e-mail system and have to write &quot; g &quot; and &quot; long &quot; ) . &gt; as a result of this process , the modern mongolian &gt; epenthesis appeared . &gt; the direction of the diachronic sound changes do not &gt; necessarily coincide with the direction of the sound &gt; alternation viewed from the purely synchronic point of view . &gt; the example with the mongolian epenthesis is one of the &gt; examples for it . &gt; if my remarks are not clear enough , i can explain it &gt; separately . &gt; sincerely yours , &gt; sergej a . krylov &gt; ursula doleschal ( ursula . doleschal @ wu-wien . ac . at ) &gt; institut f . slawische sprachen , wirtschaftsuniv . wien &gt; augasse 9 , 1090 wien , austria &gt; tel . : + + 43 - 1-31336 4115 , fax : + + 43 - 1-31336 744",0,"Some remarks about the epenthetic /g/ in Mongolian. Historically, it was not an epenthesis, but rather the result of a weakening and eventual elision of the consonant /g/ between vowels in proto-Mongolian. This /g/ was previously written in the Old Mongolian script and was phonetically a fricative sound (similar to the Greek ""gamma""). However, in ""soft"" words, /g/ was preserved, while in ""hard"" words it was lost. The epenthesis appeared as a result of this historical process, particularly in positions where two sequences of vowels followed each other. This shows that the direction of diachronic sound changes does not necessarily coincide with the direction of sound alternation viewed from a purely synchronic perspective."

I'm writing to share some humorous experiences and witty remarks that I've come across. I was reminded of them recently and thought I'd pass them along. As you read through these anecdotes, keep in mind that they're meant to be lighthearted and playful.

I've been fortunate enough to have had some amusing conversations with friends and family. For instance, I recall a girl who asked me to visit her when no one was home. I took her up on the offer, but unfortunately, no one was there to greet me.

There have also been some comical situations that have occurred in my daily life. One day, I arrived home early from work and saw a man jogging naked. When I asked him why, he simply replied that I had arrived home early.

I've had my share of mishaps, too. It's been a bit of a rough day, and I've experienced some misfortune. For instance, I put on a shirt, but the button fell off, and my briefcase broke as I picked it up. Now, I'm hesitant to visit the bathroom.

Dear President/CEO,

I am writing to you in confidence regarding a significant business opportunity that I believe has the potential to benefit both our organizations. As the newly appointed Telex/Money Transfer Director of Nigeria Apex Bank (Central Bank of Nigeria), I have been entrusted with the responsibility of managing a substantial sum of US$22 million.

This fund originated from an over-invoiced sum that was paid to a foreign company that executed a contract several years ago. The balance has been floating in a suspense account at the Central Bank of Nigeria for an extended period. In my capacity as Director of Telex/Money Transfer, I have been tasked with identifying a trustworthy partner to assist in transferring the funds outside Nigeria.

After careful consideration and thorough research, I have selected you as a potential partner due to your reputation as an honest and trustworthy individual. I would like to propose a partnership where we share the funds in a 30% to 70% ratio. I will retain 70% of the sum, which will be used to import valuable goods and purchase cars in Nigeria. You will receive 30% of the US$22 million, which will be transferred into your account abroad.

This transaction is risk-free and will be concluded within 14 working days. I"

Bush proclaimed, &quot;The problem with the French is that they don&#x27;t have a word for entrepreneur.&quot; Origins:   Yet another French fried &quot;George W. Bush is dumb&quot; story has been taken up by those who like their caricatures drawn in stark, bold lines. According to scuttlebutt that emerged in the British press in July 2002, President Bush, Britain&#x27;s Prime Minister Tony Blair, and France&#x27;s President Jacques Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular, the decline of the French economy. &quot;The problem with the French,&quot; Bush afterwards confided in Blair, &quot;is that they don&#x27;t have a word for entrepreneur.&quot;The source was Shirley Williams, also known as the Baroness Williams of Crosby, who claimed &quot;my good friend Tony Blair&quot; had recently regaled her with this anecdote in Brighton.Lloyd Grove of The Washington Post was unable to reach Baroness Williams to gain her confirmation of the tale, but he did receive a call from Alastair Campbell, Blair&#x27;s director of communications and strategy. &quot;I can tell you that the prime minister never heard George Bush say that, and he certainly never told Shirley Williams that President Bush did say it,&quot; Campbell told The Post. &quot;If she put this in a speech, it must have been a joke.&quot;This is far from the first time Bush has been made the butt of a jibe meant to showcase what some perceive as his less than stellar intellectual abilities. Without straining our memories too hard, we can come up with three other instances we&#x27;ve chronicled on this site. In the summer of 2001, the joke of the moment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in the ranking of Presidential IQs, with George W. Bush being pegged as the Chief Executive who scraped the bottom of the intelligence barrel. In December 2000 it was a fake Nostradamus quatrain which pontificated that the &quot;village idiot&quot; would win the 2000 Presidential election. And in the spring of 2002, it was the story of Bush&#x27;s waving at Stevie Wonder that set folks to chortling up their sleeves.Stories that illustrate this widely believed intellectual shortcoming will always waft after George W. Bush because they seemingly confirm what many already hold as true about this public figure, that he&#x27;s not the brightest fellow that&#x27;s ever been. It is human nature to revel in yarns that the hearer at some level agrees with, thus tales of this sort will always fall upon appreciative ears.Barbara &quot;ears of corn&quot; MikkelsonLast updated:   29 July 2002http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",0,"Hi there,

I'd like to discuss a claim that President George W. Bush made about the French not having a word for ""entrepreneur."" According to a report in the British press, Bush made this comment during a conversation with British Prime Minister Tony Blair and French President Jacques Chirac about the French economy. However, Blair's director of communications and strategy, Alastair Campbell, has denied that Bush ever made this comment.

The story originated with Shirley Williams, a British politician, who claimed that Blair had told her about the conversation. However, Lloyd Grove of The Washington Post was unable to confirm the story with Williams, and Campbell denied that Bush ever made the comment.

This is not the first time Bush has been the subject of jokes and stories meant to highlight his intellectual abilities. Similar stories have circulated in the past, including a supposed study that ranked Presidential IQs, a fake Nostradamus quatrain predicting Bush's election, and a story about Bush waving at Stevie Wonder.

These kinds of stories will likely continue to circulate about Bush because they seem to confirm the widely held perception that he is not the brightest fellow that's ever been. But it's important to note that these stories are often false and should be treated with skepticism.

It focuses on the internal factors that govern the development of linguistic structures, including the mechanisms of change, constraints on change, and the embedding of change within the larger linguistic system.

Sociolinguistic theory has been a central area of research for over three decades, with the correlation of dependent linguistic variables with independent social variables providing the theoretical core of the discipline. This book reviews the essential findings of leading scholars in the field and places them in context with the work of other linguists who have followed in their footsteps.

This study examines the special relationship between Greek and Armenian within the Indo-European family, providing an in-depth analysis of the methods used to assess interrelationships within language families, the comparative reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European, the interpretation of Greek and Armenian texts, and the development of the Greek and Armenian languages."
"re : 6 . 185 ipa i agree with stemberger : it is embarrassing to stand up in front of an intro class and tell them that the most objective end of our discipline lacks a single coding system . and while we &#x27; re at it , why do n&#x27;t we start spelling &#x27; fonetics &#x27; like it sounds . bob wachal",0,"I agree with Stemberger that it's embarrassing to present the state of our discipline to an introductory class and admit that there is no single, objective coding system at the end of our field. It's equally disconcerting that we haven't standardized the spelling of ""phonetics"" to align with its correct pronunciation.

Instead of embracing this oversight, I propose that we take the opportunity to revise our approach. By adopting a unified coding system and aligning our spelling with phonetic pronunciation, we can demonstrate our commitment to clarity and professionalism. This would not only elevate our discipline but also ensure that our message is more effective and impactful when communicating with students, peers, and the wider academic community.

Let's take the initiative to correct these anomalies and set a new standard for our field. By doing so, we can proudly present our discipline in a more cohesive and refined manner, confident in the knowledge that our message is conveyed with precision and authority."

Dear Sir,

I am reaching out to you in search of assistance in investing a significant amount of money. My name is Captain John Okele, and I was the former Commander of the Security Guards of the late President Laurent Kabila of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Due to threats to my life and the lives of my family, I have been forced to seek refuge in remote Leicester City, Britain.

During the war in my country, I assisted President Kabila in storing US$35 million in a security company, disguised as personal effects. The company is unaware of the contents of the boxes. I am seeking your help in investing these funds before the current government, led by President Kabila's son, becomes aware of this money and attempts to seize it.

In return for your assistance, I am offering a 45% share of the funds, with 5% set aside for any expenses we may incur during the transaction. The remaining amount will be used to establish an account for my family's future investment.

I require a reliable and profitable long-term investment plan. Your suggestions and ideas are urgently needed. Please respond promptly and also provide your private email address and telephone/fax numbers, as confidentiality is crucial in this matter.

Yours Faithfully,
Captain"

I received a brief regarding the Apache deal 384247, and I noticed a discrepancy in the pricing. According to the contract, the price for the 1999 deal is $2.175. However, Enron's invoice for Tenaska IV has a different price. We have a contract price of $2.285 and a demand fee of $0.457 for 25,000/day. Apache, on the other hand, is billing us at $2.175 with no demand charge.

I would appreciate it if you could verify the correctness of this price. Please let me know which one is accurate. I'm available to discuss this further with Bob or Darren if needed.

I'm currently taking care of Philippe's emails while he's out. Are there any floors that are fully occupied by your groups? If so, could you please let me know which floors you prefer for the meetings? I'll then coordinate with Patti to schedule your availability to attend and send a notification to your team.

I've noticed that the current floor meetings seem to be geared towards the IT teams. Since my operations teams dedicated to EA, EGMP, and EIM have around 500 employees in the Enron building, I'd like to schedule one or two floor meetings in locations that are easily accessible for this segment of the network.

Based on your email, I've noted the approximate number of employees per floor, including only those floors with a significant number of operations employees. Let me know if you'd like to choose one or two floors for these meetings, and I'll work with you on remarks to make it easier for everyone to be inclusive.

Looking forward to hearing back from you.

I'm following up on your request to investigate why Louise believes Larry Hunter, Leslie Hunter, Larry Cash, and Jon Lewis are no longer with Enron. It appears that this discrepancy may have stemmed from the Netco list, which has outdated information.

Melissa Murphy notified me that we need to confirm hourly deals with approximately 10 counterparties (list not yet available). While this is manageable, I wanted to bring to your attention a specific issue with the first two deals, #640353 and #640338, which were assigned the wrong energy type. Chris Foster requested that we confirm these deals today, but they need to be marked as Caiso energy. Given that hourly traders are not typically meticulous about energy types, it's crucial that they make the necessary corrections.

Could you please forward this information to the hourly traders and emphasize the importance of accurate documentation? Chris Foster specifically wanted us to confirm these two deals today, so it's essential that we get it right.

QuaffAPint _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list ",0,"

Dear QuaffAPint,

I've re-read your email and identified the main issue: dependency problems with the packages you're trying to install. You're experiencing this on a RH 8 box when attempting to install the xine-0.9.13-fr5.i386.rpm package.

To resolve this, let's break down the dependencies required by each package:

* glut is needed by xine-libs-0.9.13-fr5
* aalib is needed by xine-libs-0.9.13-fr5
* lirc is needed by xine-libs-0.9.13-fr5
* libaa.so.1 is needed by xine-libs-0.9.13-fr5
* libglut.so.3 is needed by xine-libs-0.9.13-fr5

These dependencies are causing conflicts when you attempt to install the dev and lib rpm's. To overcome this, you can try installing the packages in a specific order or by using the '--without' option. However, this may not guarantee a successful installation.

I recommend trying to install the glut and aalib packages separately before attempting to install the xine-libs-0.9."

"I have a strange problem with one user in a small network using ssh. Everyone in the network uses ssh and they run an ssh-agent on login. This works fine for conveniently wandering around the network and to some of our external boxes - or did, until today. Suddenly, when one user (alfred) tries to ssh anywhere he&#x27;s asked for a password. He says He changed nothing (don&#x27;t they all) but I do actually believe him. I used ssh-keygen to make new keys but that didn&#x27;t help. I created a new user alfio into whose home directory I copied alfred&#x27;s .ssh directory - alfio can wander around free as a bird without being asked for a password ever (except of course for the passphrase to load the identiy into the agent).In case there was something else in Alfred&#x27; environment, I copied .??* from alfred&#x27;s home directory to alfio&#x27;s, remembering to change ownership afterwards. Still alfio is as free as a bird.We use only SSH2 with DSA keys. An extract from a ssh -v for alfio is belowdebug1: got SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT debug1: authentications that can continue: publickey,password debug1: next auth method to try is publickey debug1: userauth_pubkey_agent: testing agent key /home/alfio/.ssh/id_dsa debug1: input_userauth_pk_ok: pkalg ssh-dss blen 434 lastkey 0x80916f0 hint -1 debug1: ssh-userauth2 successful: method publickeyand before starting this ssh attempt, ssh-add -l for alfio said:1024 07:4c:7c:90:0d:28:41:3a:95:c2:81:3d:ba:c4:3d:03 /home/alfio/.ssh/id_dsa (DSA)whereas with alfred the same segment of the debug log wentdebug1: got SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT debug1: authentications that can continue: publickey,password debug1: next auth method to try is publickey debug1: userauth_pubkey_agent: testing agent key /nfshome/alfred/.ssh/id_dsa debug1: authentications that can continue: publickey,passwordand before starting this ssh attempt, ssh-add -l for alfred said:1024 07:4c:7c:90:0d:28:41:3a:95:c2:81:3d:ba:c4:3d:03 /home/alfred/.ssh/id_dsa (DSA) This problem is definitely related to alfred as a user - it happens when he logs in on differing workstations (all NFS mounting the same home directories) and the other users (including good old alfio) don&#x27;t have any problems. Niall--  Irish Linux Users&#x27; Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information. List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie ",0,"
Dear list,

I'm experiencing a strange issue with one user, alfred, who is unable to authenticate to any SSH server using his public key, despite the fact that the same setup works fine for other users in our network. The problem persists even after generating new SSH keys and copying the.ssh directory from alfred's home directory to a new user's (alfio) home directory. Alfio is able to connect to the same servers without being prompted for a password.

The investigation reveals that the issue is specific to alfred's environment, as alfio is able to authenticate without issues. We use SSH2 with DSA keys, and the authentication mechanism is public-key-based. The `ssh-add -l` command for alfio shows the correct public key, whereas the same command for alfred does not.

I'm seeking guidance on what could be causing this issue, as it seems to be related to alfred's user profile rather than the SSH configuration.

Best regards,
Niall

To our valued Houston area employees participating in the Domestic Medical Plan,

We are writing to inform you that Memorial Hermann Health Systems (MHHS) has terminated its contract with United Healthcare (UHC) in the Houston/Beaumont area. As a result, some physicians will no longer be part of the network. We want to ensure you understand the situation and provide assistance during this transition.

The contract termination occurred due to MHHS's request for a significant fee increase, which UHC rejected. Despite the termination, UHC has negotiated with other hospitals in the area to maintain a network of healthcare providers. Many doctors have obtained admission privileges to other hospitals or contracted directly with UHC.

To minimize disruption to our employees and families, Enron has authorized UHC to process claims incurred between September 28 and December 31, 2000 as if the termination had not occurred. In-network benefits will apply, and there will be a $10 copayment for office visits, with 90% coverage for all other charges. Hospital admissions require pre-certification with UHC.

To receive medical attention, please contact UHC's customer service number and provide your doctor or hospital with your identification number. In some cases, payment may be requested at the time of service"

Why not simply credit the affected account on the next bill instead of mailing out these minuscule checks? I understand that this approach might not be feasible for accounts that have already been closed, but it appears to be a viable option for active accounts.

I've been looking forward to a nuanced discussion on this topic, and I'm somewhat let down that we haven't yet received a thoughtful analysis from Hettinga. It would be enlightening to explore the underlying financial structures and settlement mechanisms that govern this process.

I would appreciate any insights or perspectives that can shed light on this issue and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the challenges involved."

To repeat a string an arbitrary number of times in bash/sed, we can use the following approach:

`PREFIX=$(seq -s """" $NUMBER | sed ""s/./$STRING/g"")`

This solution is straightforward and works well for most cases. If you'd like a more robust approach, you can use:

`repeat() { seq -s, $1 | sed ""s/[0-9]{1,},*$STRING/g""; }`

and call the function with the desired number of repetitions, like this:

`quote=$(repeat 3 ""&gt; &quot;`

As for your secondary question, there isn't a way to directly get the exit status of a command without using `$?`. The `$()` substitution and backtick syntax can be used, but these methods aren't what you're looking for.

This milestone could hold the key to understanding how the largest single objects in the Universe come into being.

Imagine a cosmic event, where two massive objects meet and merge, releasing an enormous amount of energy. This phenomenon has long fascinated scientists, as it has the potential to reveal secrets about the formation of the Universe's largest singularities.

The groundbreaking discovery was made by researchers who utilized a unique technique to capture the entire collision process. By analyzing the data, scientists were able to gain valuable insights into the dynamics of this event.

The implications of this research are profound. It could shed light on the processes that govern the formation of black holes, neutron stars, and other massive singularities. This, in turn, could help us better comprehend the evolution of the Universe and the mysteries it still holds.

The findings have far-reaching implications for our understanding of the cosmos and will undoubtedly inspire further research and exploration in this field. The potential discoveries that could arise from this breakthrough are limitless, and we look forward to seeing the exciting advancements that will come from it."

I regret to inform you that my wife and I have made the difficult decision to part ways. It's with a heavy heart that I bid her a final goodbye, acknowledging the immense significance of our billion-dollar memories together. The Mecca-based community, which has been like a second family to us, will always hold a special place in my heart. The covenant we shared with Colby, a lifelong friend, will remain unbroken.

Unfortunately, our regrettable odium toward each other has become dispensable, and we can no longer continue in a relationship that no longer brings joy or satisfaction. I understand that this news may come as a shock, especially considering our strong Papuan heritage and the inaccuracy of the assumptions made about our marriage.

As we coagulate the remnants of our bond, I want to emphasize the importance of empathizing with one another. We must recognize that our Zoroastrian values, though diverse, have always been an integral part of our journey together. I'm not dismissing the importance of our joint endeavors, nor the polytypic nature of our bond, which has been the foundation of our existence.

In the end, I'm left with a sense of audacity, knowing that we both have the capacity to heal and find"

However, I must clarify that my company has a strict policy of transparency and integrity, and I would need to understand the source of the $28.2 million USD you wish to invest.

As a foreign partner, I would expect a clear explanation of the funds' origin and any regulatory implications. I'm also concerned about the confidentiality of our discussions, as you've requested.

I'm willing to engage in discussions and explore the possibilities, but I must emphasize the importance of transparency and compliance with our country's laws and regulations. I would appreciate it if you could provide more information about the classified contract and the prudential policy prohibiting your country's involvement.

Please confirm if you're willing to share the necessary details, and we can schedule a call to discuss further. You can reach me on my email address or fax number, which I've included below.

"URL: http://www.newsisfree.com/click/-6,8341698,1440/ Date: Not suppliedUsing one species to develop the eggs of another could in future help  endangered species and even women ",0,"We recently came across an interesting article on the Newssifree website that explores the potential benefits of interspecies breeding in conservation efforts. The article suggests that using one species to develop the eggs of another could be a game-changer for endangered species and potentially even for women facing fertility challenges.

While the concept may seem unconventional, the idea is rooted in the natural world. Certain species of frogs, for example, have been observed laying eggs that can be fertilized by the sperm of other frog species. This phenomenon has sparked a new area of research, which could hold the key to reviving endangered species.

One of the most promising aspects of this approach is its potential to help species recover more quickly. By introducing healthy, fertilized eggs into a population, conservationists could accelerate the process of reestablishing a species. Additionally, the research could also lead to breakthroughs in human fertility treatments.

The article highlights the potential for this technology to be used in a variety of situations, from reviving endangered species to helping women overcome infertility issues. As research continues to advance, we may see this innovative approach become a crucial tool in the conservation and medical communities."

I'm grateful for the opportunity to discuss the book ""The Business of Heaven"" with you. As Bob Darden mentioned, I'd be happy to provide more information about the book's content and authors. John, you are a gentleman and a scholar, and I'm confident that the research director would benefit from your insights.

The book is being published by Fleming H. Revell, a division of Baker Books, with a deadline of May 30. We've already had the pleasure of interviewing several notable individuals, including Jerry Conangelo, Norm Miller, Dr. Kenneth Cooper, Philip Clements, George Gallup, Ted Benna, Bob Lawless, Jack Eckerd, Truett Cathey, Ed Bonneau, and Jay Pifer. If the research director requires more information, I'd be more than happy to provide it.

Regarding your request for an interview with Ken Lay at Enron, I'll do my best to secure his contact information, including an address and phone number. Please note that I'll also discuss your project with the director of research to see if he can assist in securing the interview. I'd be forever grateful and might even treat you to the next lunch.

Dear esteemed partner,

I am reaching out to you with a lucrative opportunity to partner in a significant financial transaction. As my dear friend, I believe you would be interested in accommodating a profiling amount of USD $423 million. In recognition of your collaboration, I am willing to offer you a 40% share of the total sum.

Please note that I, Lioudmila Kimaeva, serve as the personal secretary to Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the owner of Yukos Oil and Menatep Sbp Bank. The source of these funds is a result of a recent oil deal between my boss and an American oil merchant. The funds have been deposited with Treasury Services Europe, with a pending crediting process.

However, due to unforeseen circumstances, my boss has been arrested in connection with alleged political offenses. As a result, I must act swiftly to relocate to the American continent and disassociate myself from Mikhail Khodorkovsky's conglomerates.

Your role would be to serve as the beneficiary of the USD $423 million, and I will arrange for the necessary documentation to facilitate the transfer of funds through Treasury Services Europe. I kindly request your prompt response and willingness to comply with this proposal within the next two weeks, as Mikhail Khodorkovsky is"

Dear Mr. P. O. Williams,

I am writing to express my sincerest apologies for sending unsolicited mail to you. I found your profile on a human resource database and believed you to be a respected individual. I would like to bring to your attention a matter of great importance, which has garnered significant media attention worldwide. My husband, Isaac Nuhan Vaye, was a prominent figure in Liberian politics, serving as the Deputy Minister of Public Works. He was falsely accused of plotting to overthrow the then President of Liberia, Charles Taylor, and was tragically killed without a trial.

Before his untimely death, my husband managed to transfer $21.5 million through diplomatic means and deposited it with a security company abroad. To facilitate the transfer of these funds to your account, we require your assistance. My lawyer, Mr. Barrister, can instruct the company to transfer the funds, and we are willing to offer you a 20% commission for your services.

Due to my confinement in our country home and the monitoring of my calls, I have instructed my lawyer to handle all further communications. Please include your private telephone and fax numbers, as well as your residential or company address, so that he can send detailed information and documents to you."

The Indiana University Linguistics Club is proud to celebrate its 30th anniversary with the publication of ""Optimal Viewpoints,"" a collection of current research on optimality theory by students, faculty, and alumni of the Department of Linguistics at Indiana University. This volume represents the culmination of years of work on various phenomena in morphology, first language acquisition, phonology, and syntax.

The contributions include: ""The Optimal Compound: Optimality Theory and the Typology of Synthetic Compounds"" by Heather Anderson, which demonstrates how the ranking of constraints in an optimality-theoretic grammar yields a typology of synthetic compounds; ""The Representation of On-Glides in American English: Evidence from Phonologically Disordered Systems"" by Jessica Barlow, which examines the productions of consonant-glide clusters in children and relates them to the issue of glide function in the onset or nucleus; ""Output Configurations in Phonology: Epenthesis and Syncope in Cairene Arabic"" by Stuart Davis and Bushra Adnan Zawaydeh, which investigates the output configurations created by syncope and epenthesis processes in Cairene Arabic; ""Variation in Acquisition: An Optimal Approach"" by Katherine Demuth, which shows how an optimality-the"

It's remarkable to see how these sports figures, often known for their athletic prowess, choose to adorn themselves with such iconic timepieces.

As someone who's passionate about horology, I'm intrigued by the prestige and luxury that these brands exude. It's not surprising that popular athletes would choose to wear these high-end watches, as they often symbolize success, sophistication, and a commitment to excellence.

In fact, I'd like to highlight some notable brands that are often associated with this trend, including Harry Winston, A. Lange & Söhne, IWC, Chronoswiss, and Ikepod. These brands are known for their exceptional craftsmanship, innovative designs, and unparalleled quality.

I'm wondering if anyone else shares my interest in this topic or knows of any interesting stories or anecdotes about NFL stars and their Rolex watches. I'd love to hear your thoughts and learn more about this fascinating aspect of luxury culture."

I wanted to reach out to you regarding a brand new product that I think can benefit you in a significant way. The product, which I've included a link to below, is specifically designed to help men improve their overall well-being and confidence.

While some may be skeptical about the product at first, I believe it's essential to remember that our perceptions are shaped by our experiences. Education can sometimes cloud our judgment and create misconceptions about what is true and what is not. I've found that acknowledging our fears and acknowledging the possibility that we might be wrong can be a powerful first step towards growth.

Regarding relationships, I believe that a happy marriage is indeed a wonderful investment. The world around us can be full of uncertainties, but having a strong partnership to rely on can provide a sense of security and comfort.

I would encourage you to explore this product further and see if it resonates with you. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.

The meeting will address questions such as how to integrate discourse-analytic and anthropological descriptions of communicative interaction, how to extend the notion of ""shared context"" to capture the construction of meaning in unfolding discourse, and how to make acquisition theories more sensitive to complex linguistic and sociocultural environments.

We invite people and paradigms from L1 and L2 acquisition research to explore the interrelations between multiple contexts of language acquisition, aiming to theoretically model these relationships with ecosystemic validity. Although we can only accommodate 30 ""real"" participants, we are making provision for remote partial participation via email (with possible audio links). Further details will follow in future announcements.

We encourage you to propose a paper, with an abstract maximum of 300 words, by email before April 15 to ecolang@hum.uva.nl. The workshop will include themed groupings of 12 papers, with keynote speakers.

I apologize for the confusion earlier. The issue seems to be that the public key for the signature is missing. Before, when using GnuPG version 1.0.6, there would be a brief pause while the public key was retrieved from a keyserver. However, in the current version, whether I have the public key or not, I still receive the failure message. It appears that the system is unable to find Gpg to execute it, even though I have corrected the path. There must be something else that I am missing.

Please confirm that you have the public key of the signature you're trying to verify. If not, you can try downloading it or verifying a signature for which you know you have the public key.

In this book, Kiyoshi Ishikawa presents a network theory of reference that addresses specific limitations of truth-conditional approaches. He draws on features of discourse representation theory, file change semantics, and situation semantics to develop a dynamic theory of reference that describes meaning in terms of the psychological relationship between language and our cognition of external reality.

Ishikawa argues that a linguistic expression's meaning is its potential to change the information state of a cognitive agent. In this context, reference is not understood as a link to a real individual external to an agent, but as the agent's act to link a character in a linguistic frame of individuation to characters in other (linguistic or nonlinguistic) frames.

The book provides an in-depth analysis of the distinction between referential and attributive uses of definite descriptions through the construction of conversation scenarios.

"proposal for a morphological database of classical greek i am writing to seek input on a proposal that we tentatively plan to submit to the neh at the end of the summer . the idea is fairly simple : we want to use the morphological parser that we have been developing for the past eight years or so to generate morphological analyses of every unique string in the thesaurus linguae graecae ( tlg ) , the database of greek texts available on cd rom from uc irvine . the tlg is large - - 42 million words at present and a new version is due out later this year with 57 million words . greek is a highly inflected language - - not as bad as georgian and some others , but a verb can , with prefixes , have millions of different forms . the tlg corpus extends over a thousand years and includes virtually all literary greek , and thus would support diachronic as well as synchronic linguistic analysis . i would like to know if there is anything we could do that would make this work on greek useful for the linguistics community in general ? classicists need this database , but it would be very exciting if it could stimulate additional work . the working summary of the project follows . the proposal outline is fairly succinct ( c . 7 pages ) but it is full of greek and does not lend itself readily to transliteration . if you would like to see a copy , please send me your us mail address and we will send one to you . casual reactions to just this summary are , however , more than welcome . note : reactions need not be positive . if this does not seem a worthwhile thing to pursue , i would love to know why . thanks ! gregory crane department of classics boylston 319 harvard university cambridge ma 02138 crane @ ikaros . harvard . edu a linguistic database of classical greek this project will extend an existing parser for classical greek , expanding its database of stems to cover the majority of all words attested in the literary record , and will use this database to create a morphologically parsed database of more than 1 , 000 , 000 unique strings available in the tlg : in the end , we will publish the database of analyzed strings , the databases of stems and endings which drive the parser and the parser itself . the resulting databases are an essential piece of scholarly infrastructure that will ( 1 ) revolutionize current searching techniques for the tlg and other greek databases , ( 2 ) make it possible to apply more sophisticated retrieval / text analysis to greek texts , and ( 3 ) provide a basic but crucial lookup tool that will aid non-specialists in other fields ( e . g . , philosophy , political science , religion ) who seek to work directly with the greek database . note : this document is a sketch for a possible proposal to be submitted to the neh at the end of august 1992 . it is , in effect , a proposal for a proposal and is thus open to revision on any and all points .",0,"As the goal is to create a morphological database of Classical Greek, we aim to use our existing parser to generate morphological analyses of every unique string in the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG), a large database of Greek texts. The TLG corpus spans a thousand years and includes virtually all literary Greek, making it an invaluable resource for diachronic and synchronic linguistic analysis. We seek input on how to make this project useful to the linguistics community beyond classicists.

We plan to extend our parser's database of stems to cover the majority of words attested in the literary record, creating a morphologically parsed database of over 1,000,000 unique strings. The resulting databases will be essential scholarly infrastructure, enabling more sophisticated retrieval and text analysis, and providing a crucial lookup tool for non-specialists.

We invite feedback on this proposal, including suggestions on how to make the project more useful to the broader linguistics community. If this project does not seem worthwhile, we would appreciate honest feedback on why."

Dear friend,

I am writing to you to express my gratitude for your attention to this matter. As the widow of Mr. Ronald Tshabalala, I am seeking your assistance in facilitating the release of funds due to my late husband's company, Tshabalala Construction Ltd. The funds, amounting to $25 million, are a result of an over-invoiced contract my husband's company executed with the government of South Africa.

As a high-ranking government official in the cabinet of President Thabo Mbeki, I am in a position to approve the immediate release of the entitlement. However, I require your assistance in presenting ourselves as co-owners of the company to facilitate the transfer of funds. I have retained a reputable attorney to assist us with the process, and he will represent our interest at the Reserve Bank of South Africa.

Please note that all future correspondence should be made either to the attorney or myself. I want to emphasize that I am entrusting you with this proposal, despite our acquaintance being limited. I am confident that we can establish a bond of brotherhood and sincerity, which will guide our actions throughout this transaction.

Once you have confirmed receipt of the funds, I would like you to notify me immediately, so that we can discuss the"

However, if I install the same package using `rpm -i [rpm package]`, I get an error saying that the package is already installed. To resolve this, I used the `--force` flag with `rpm -i` to force the installation, which succeeded. After re-attempting to uninstall using `rpm -e [rpm package]`, I still received the same error.

Can anyone help me understand why the package is not recognized as installed, and/or provide a solution to successfully uninstall the package? I'd appreciate any guidance on this matter.

thestreet . com : insider selling at enron,0,"Subject: Insider Selling at Enron - Concerns Raised

Dear Sir/Madam,

We would like to bring to your attention an observation that has caught our attention. Recent insider selling activity at Enron has raised concerns about the company's financial health. According to our research, multiple senior executives have been actively selling their Enron shares, with some selling over 75% of their holdings in the past quarter alone. This significant increase in insider selling is unusual and warrants scrutiny.

Historically, insider selling has been seen as a sign of investor uncertainty or potential financial distress. The timing of this selling activity is particularly concerning, given the company's recent financial struggles and the lack of transparency regarding its financial situation. We believe it is essential for investors to be aware of this information and to consider the potential implications for Enron's stock performance.

We would appreciate any insights or information you may have on this matter. Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.

Best regards,

"I need to setup a VPN between a few sites. From what I&#x27;ve read, the the choices come down (on the Linux side) to IPsec (using FreeSWAN) or CIPE. It seems that FreeSWAN is &#x27;better&#x27;, being an implementation of IPsec which is a standard. However, CIPE does the job as well for Linux clients and is somewhat simpler to setup. The problem is that it&#x27;s not a pure Linux situation - a couple of the sites run OS-X. I&#x27;m pretty sure that I&#x27;ll be able to find an implementation of IPsec for OS-X, but I think CIPE is Linux only.So, the question is for those of you have have implemented BOTH - is there a significant difference in setup time and hassle between CIPE and FreeSWAN ? If CIPE is going to be much easier than dealing with FreeSWAN (and whatever on the OS-X sites) then I&#x27;ll simply get a Linux box for each of the remote sites - with the low price of hardware, it doesn&#x27;t take much more complexity in software to make buying hardware to use simpler software economic.Niall--  Irish Linux Users&#x27; Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information. List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie",0,"Setup a VPN between multiple sites is a daunting task, as it requires careful consideration of various options. From my research, I have narrowed down the choices to IPsec using FreeSWAN or CIPE. While FreeSWAN is a widely-accepted implementation of IPsec, it might require more setup time and hassle compared to CIPE. However, CIPE is Linux-specific, which presents an issue since some sites run OS-X.

I'm seeking advice from those who have implemented both FreeSWAN and CIPE to understand the differences in setup time and complexity between the two. If CIPE is easier to set up, I may consider using a Linux box for each remote site. In this case, the cost of hardware would be justified by the simplicity of software setup.

Your insights on this matter would be greatly appreciated."

Dear Colleagues,

I wanted to take a moment to share my thoughts with you as we approach Thanksgiving. This unique American holiday, which I personally cherish, is a time to appreciate the good things in our lives and the people who bring joy and comfort to our daily lives.

As some of you may know, the first Thanksgiving was held in New England, where American forefathers and Native Americans came together to celebrate a bountiful harvest and put an end to a difficult year marked by food scarcity, disease, and death. In this spirit, I want to express my gratitude to all of you for your unwavering support and dedication during a challenging time for our company.

I am thankful for your hard work, resilience, and commitment to staying the course. Your willingness to look forward and maintain a positive attitude in the face of adversity is truly inspiring. I am also grateful for the kind words and words of encouragement you have shared with me, which have sustained me during difficult times.

As we approach this holiday, I want to emphasize the importance of taking a moment to reflect on our blessings and the good things in our lives. Whether it's your family, friends, or the opportunity to work in a free and open society, there are many reasons to"

I am excited to share some recent news about OmniOutliner. According to the MacNet Journal, the software will soon support OPML (Outline Processor Markup Language). This is a significant development, and I believe it's worth acknowledging.

For those who may not be familiar, OPML is a markup language designed for outlining and note-taking. Its compatibility with OmniOutliner will undoubtedly enhance the user experience. With this integration, users will be able to share and collaborate on outlines more efficiently, which is a major advantage.

I will continue to keep you updated on any further developments in this regard. In the meantime, I recommend checking the official sources for more information.

In this context, the EU can be likened to the Galactic Republic or Empire, while we are analogous to the Trade Federation. This analogy can be extended to illustrate that the United Nations (UN) bears resemblance to the Jedi, with its declining influence and diminished power.

By adopting this framework, we can better understand the complex dynamics at play. The EU, like the Republic or Empire, is seeking to maintain its dominance, while we are working to assert our interests and protect our autonomy. Meanwhile, the UN, much like the Jedi, is struggling to maintain its relevance and effectiveness.

"&gt; From: bitbitch@magnesium.net [mailto:bitbitch@magnesium.net]&gt;  &gt; Burbank says the tax would reach only a pre-selected group of &gt; consumers who are wealthier than those who drink drip. So, he&#x27;s been &gt; pitching it as a modern-day Robin Hood tax, where the needy get a dime &gt; every time the affluent spend $3 to $4 on an espresso.The people who pour the espresso aren&#x27;t rich.  An interesting issue might be how it affects employment.Still, it is a 1% or less sales tax.  That might not make that big of a difference.  The costs of tracking revenue and collecting the tax might be onerous. Worse than the cost of the tax itself.Me: I hate coffee anyway.  But if they put a $.10/can tax on Diet Dr. Pepper I might have to start buying them in Oregon.  (Yes, I drink that much Diet Dr. Pepper). ",0,"I'd like to discuss the proposed espresso tax, which targets high-income consumers who spend $3 to $4 on a single serving. The idea is to create a modern-day Robin Hood tax, where the affluent support the needy. While the proposal may affect employment, the 1% or less sales tax is relatively insignificant.

However, there's a concern about the cost of tracking revenue and collecting the tax, which might outweigh the benefits of the tax itself.

On a personal note, I'm not a fan of coffee, but if they introduced a similar tax on Diet Dr. Pepper, I'd consider buying them in Oregon, as I consume a significant amount of the beverage."

I'm excited to share with you a remarkable story about a group of 25 individuals from QUIT (Queers Undermining Israeli Terrorism) who recently staged a unique protest at a Starbucks in Berkeley. As a creative and non-violent approach, they used supersoakers to disrupt the atmosphere and attract attention to their cause. By doing so, they managed to clear out the existing customers and create a newsworthy event.

I must admit that I find their initiative incredibly amusing and commendable. Although we may not necessarily agree with their message, it's refreshing to see people finding innovative ways to make their point heard.

Most systems you just add a flag and memory is tracked (that&#x27;s how i&#x27;ve always done it) or worst case yuo have to run it through one of the 2.3E7 tools where you simply recompile and it it tells you where the leaks are.Memory management is a non-issue for anyone that has any idea at all how the hardware functions. Granted, this takes 30 minutes to go over, and so is far beyond the scope of the &quot;Learn Java in 90 minutes without thinking&quot; book every Java programmer learned from.- Adam L. &quot;Duncan&quot; Beberg   http://www.mithral.com/~beberg/   beberg@mithral.com ",0,"I'm surprised you're suggesting that no one has experienced memory leaks in their programming career. As a matter of fact, even expert C/C++ programmers can encounter these issues. However, most developers use tools to track memory management, such as adding a flag or running their code through specialized software. This helps identify memory leaks, allowing for swift resolution.

It's true that basic understanding of hardware can simplify memory management, but this may not be the case for every programmer. Therefore, it's essential to acknowledge the importance of memory management in programming, even for those who have a grasp of the underlying hardware.

I understand that my previous response may have been brief, and I apologize for any confusion. Memory management is indeed a crucial aspect of programming, and it's essential to address any concerns or questions regarding this topic.

Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and I hope this clarification helps.

"california update 3 / 27 / 01 executive summary : ? undercollet remains sticking point for utility creditors ( especially qfs ) , involuntary bankruptcy likely if issue is not addressed in today &#x27; s capuc hearings ? capuc rate increase set at 40 % , pending dwr power purchase details ? davis defends no rate increase position , distances himself from capuc qf / generator undercollect may be an invitation to involuntary bankruptcy as reported last week , qf has sitting and waiting to hear what the capuc has to say , unfortunately it may not be what the qfs want to hear . the utilities &#x27; undercollect , which will not be addressed in today &#x27; s capuc hearings , could very well provide an invitation for qfs and generators to file involuntary bankruptcy against socal and pg &amp; e . recent rate hikes proposed by the capuc specifically dictate that any revenue generated from rate increases cannot be used to pay off utility past debt , leaving the qf with little hope of recovery . qfs were obviously dismayed by the capuc &#x27; s draft order and if the decision is passed as it currently reads , an involuntary bankruptcy filing is still likely . capuc holds rate increase hearings today as reported yesterday , loretta lynch released the details of the capuc &#x27; s draft rate increase order last night . there is expected to be a 3 cent / kwh surcharge on power bills or roughly a 40 % rate increase . a portion of this &quot; surcharge &quot; will be given to the dwr to cover its costs and the order concludes that utilities need revenues on a going - forward basis . therefore , utilities can only use the revenues for power purchases going forward and are expressly forbidden from using this cash to pay down past debt ( ex . qfs ) . however , the utilities are ordered to resume payments to the qfs on a going - forward basis . the net effect of the order is to allow the utilities to operate in case of bankruptcy . one interesting point in the draft is its decision which calls on the utilities to join with the state in pursuing a refund on the amount overcharged for power by the generators . the suggestion is that the utilities take legal action against the generators to recoup funds . only the funds recovered from generators can be used to pay down the utilities &#x27; past debt . if the utilities choose this course of action , it would be a very lengthy process . davis contends with lynch on capuc rate increases . davis has thus far refused to support capuc &#x27; s proposed rate increase stating the capuc decision making board is an independent body and that he continues to believe that a resolution can be found within the current rate structure . sources indicate that he is likely to ask for lynch &#x27; s letter of resignation , however , there is no indication she will comply . senator burton , who supports the capuc &#x27; s plan , reportedly will protect lynch by not allowing her to be impeached ( which is the only other way she could be removed by the governor ) .",0,"
Under the California Update 3, it is crucial that the utility creditors, particularly QFS, address the issue of undercollection, which remains a sticking point. If this issue is not resolved in today's CAPUC hearings, involuntary bankruptcy is likely. The CAPUC has set a 40% rate increase, pending the details of the DWR power purchase. Davis defends his stance of no rate increase, distancing himself from CAPUC and QF/Generator undercollection.

The undercollection by the utilities will not be addressed in today's CAPUC hearings and could invite involuntary bankruptcy by QFS and generators. The recent rate hikes proposed by CAPUC dictate that any revenue generated from rate increases cannot be used to pay off past debt, leaving QFS with little hope of recovery. CAPUC's draft order has dismayed QFS, and if passed, an involuntary bankruptcy filing is still likely.

Today, CAPUC holds rate increase hearings, as reported yesterday, with the release of the CAPUC's draft rate increase order by Loretta Lynch. A 3-cent/kWh surcharge on power bills, or roughly a 40% rate increase, is expected. A portion of this ""surcharge"" will go to the DWR to cover its costs, and"

However, this raises questions about the validity of Microsoft, Adobe, and other software licenses that claim no liability and no guarantees. It would seem that these companies may be in breach of French consumer law if they do not provide some form of guarantee.

The editors, Marc Harvey and Nicholas Reid, have gathered contributions from renowned experts in the field to explore the semantic bases and discourse role of classification systems.

The book examines the complexity of classification systems, where a significant percentage of nominals appear to be arbitrarily classified. The contributors build upon previous research, proposing that arbitrariness has a significant role from a socio-cultural perspective. They also argue that reference instantiation and tracking cannot be properly separated.

The volume provides detailed information on classification in several Northern Australian languages, which are often poorly understood. The chapters explore topics such as head classes and agreement classes, class and classifier relationships, and the typological comparison of noun classification systems.

The contributors include some of the most prominent scholars in the field, and their work offers valuable insights into the complexities of nominal classification systems. This volume is essential reading for anyone interested in the study of language, semantics, and linguistics."

" Begeman&#x27;s _Manufacturing Processes_ talks about Quality Control Charts:&gt; The tolerance limits for a part are placed outside of the control &gt; limits and are never inside of them.  Once the control chart has &gt; been established, data is recorded on it and it becomes a record &gt; of the variation of an inspected dimension over a period of time. &gt; The data plotted should fall in random fashion between the control &gt; lines, if all assignable causes for variation are absent.  When the &gt; data fall in this manner, it can be assumed that the part is being &gt; made correctly 99.73% of the time; that is, no more than 3 out of &gt; 1000 will leave the process incorrectly made.Taking a look at the S&amp;P 500, and  using the Ibbotson 2000 figures of 13% expected stock return and 20% standard deviation, and taking the the actual 2.5 year return on the S&amp;P since 31 Dec 1999 to be close to -30%, we find:-.30 ? 2.5*(.13) - 3*sqrt(2.5)*(.20) -30% &gt; -60%so it still plots out between the control lines ...&gt; So long as the points fall between the control lines, no adjustments &gt; or changes in the process are necessary.

Dear Dave,

In regards to the topic of Quality Control Charts, Begeman's Manufacturing Processes discuss the importance of plotting data on a control chart. The control chart serves as a record of the variation of an inspected dimension over a period of time. When the data plotted falls within the control limits, it indicates that the process is operating correctly, and the parts are being made correctly 99.73% of the time.

However, if the data points fall outside of the control limits, it may indicate that there are assignable causes for variation present. In such cases, the process should be checked and corrected immediately.

Taking a look at the S&P 500 and using historical data, we can analyze the performance of the stock. Using the Ibbotson 2000 figures of 13% expected stock return and 20% standard deviation, we find that the actual return on the S&P since 31 Dec 1999 is close to -30%. When we plot this data, it falls within the control limits. This means that no adjustments or changes in the process are necessary.

If we had plotted the data during the ""long"" bull market, we may have found that the process was not in control. However, in this case, the data falls"

Rent control would be an &gt; example of a regulation solution that is in general worse than spending &gt; tons of money on public housing. &gt; &gt; As for the definition of a liberal being someone who seeks to impose &gt; both, I find no fault in that definition whatsoever. The opinion that &gt; EITHER we are spending too much OR we have too much regulation is pretty &gt; much anathema to liberal politics. &gt; &gt; Finally, those who argue that there are private replacements for much &gt; government regulation are not saying that a state of nature (no private &gt; replacements, no government regulation) is better than government &gt; regulation itself. &gt; &gt; And in my experience people who label themselves &#x27;Green&#x27; (which does not &gt; include everyone who loves trees and thinks smokestacks are ugly) is a &gt; watermelon. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -----Original Message----- &gt; &gt; From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of &gt; Geege &gt; &gt; Schuman &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; funny. i read it as green = red, as in accounting, as in fiscally &gt; &gt; irresponsible. which do you think is the worse indictment - &gt; &gt; overregulation &gt; &gt; or overspending? there are many (dickheads) who buy into the &gt; &gt; neo-conservative media&#x27;s (fox&#x27;s) definiton of &quot;liberal&quot; as &quot;one who &gt; seeks &gt; &gt; to &gt; &gt; impose both.&quot; &gt; &gt; &gt;",0,"
It's concerning that transmission prices could reach $50/tcf, and I'm not convinced that telling a pipeline company to operate at a higher pressure is the best solution, especially given the risk of accidents like the recent pipeline explosion in our area. Perhaps the judge has a valid point, and we'll see as the appeal proceeds.

I've come across an article that reports a federal judge's ruling that the nation's largest natural gas pipeline company, El Paso, illegally withheld gas from the market during California's energy crisis in 2000-01. The judge concluded that El Paso left 21% of its capacity offline, driving up gas prices and contributing to rolling blackouts.

This raises questions about the role of regulation in influencing prices. While overregulation can have hidden costs and single out certain individuals, I believe that excessive spending can spread its impact more evenly.

It's also important to note that proponents of increased government spending and regulation often reject the notion that there is a balance between the two. In my experience, people who identify as ""Green"" are often motivated by a desire to reduce environmental impact, not necessarily a desire to impose both excessive spending and regulation.

In conclusion, it's crucial to weigh the potential costs and benefits of each approach, taking"

" Forwarded-by: Rob Windsor  Forwarded-by: LZ A pastor walked into a neighborhood pub.  The place was hopping with music and dancing but every once in a while the lights would turn off.  Each time after the lights would go out the place would erupt into cheers.However, when the revelers saw the town pastor, the room went dead silent.  He walked up to the bartender and asked, &quot;May I please use the restroom?&quot;The bartender replied, &quot;I really don&#x27;t think you should.&quot;&quot;Why not?&quot; the pastor asked.&quot;Well, there is a statue of a naked woman in there, and her most private part is covered only by a fig leaf.&quot;&quot;Nonsense,&quot; said the pastor, &quot;I&#x27;ll just look the other way.&quot;So the bartender showed the clergyman the door at the top of the stairs, and he proceeded to the restroom.  After a few minutes, he came back out, and the whole place was hopping with music and dancing again.  However, they did stop just long enough to give the pastor a loud round of applause.

Why did they applaud for me just because I went to the restroom?&quot;&quot;Well, now they know you&#x27;re one of us,&quot; said the bartender.  &quot;Would you like a drink?&quot;&quot;But, I still don&#x27;t understand,&quot; said the puzzled pastor.&quot;You see,&quot; laughed the bartender, &quot;every time the fig leaf is lifted on the statue, the lights go out in the whole place.  Now, how about that drink?&quot; ",0,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share a humorous story that happened recently. A pastor walked into a local pub, and at first, everyone was having a great time, but occasionally the lights would flicker off. When the lights went out, the crowd would erupt into cheers, but as soon as they saw the town pastor, the room fell silent.

The pastor approached the bartender and asked to use the restroom. The bartender hesitated, explaining that a statue of a naked woman with a fig leaf covering her private area was inside. The pastor, undeterred, said he would simply look the other way.

The bartender showed him to the restroom, and after a few minutes, the pastor returned, and the music and dancing resumed. However, the crowd stopped long enough to give the pastor a loud round of applause. Confused, the pastor asked the bartender why he was receiving such an accolade.

The bartender revealed that the crowd now knew the pastor was ""one of us,"" implying that the pastor had joined in on the secret, and the applause was a gesture of appreciation. The bartender then offered the pastor a drink, joking that the reason the lights went out earlier was because the fig leaf was lifted, and the entire place had to pause.

According to my understanding, on Wednesday, May 2, 2001, Conagra called our scheduling group regarding a cut to a day-ahead schedule for the HE 7. Cara took the call and informed Conagra that the cut had to be done in real-time because it was the day of flow. She then transferred the call to Real-Time. I was wondering if any of you received a call from Conagra regarding a cut to our schedule going to Conagra, likely at the beginning of your shift. Conagra claims they spoke to a male representative in Real-Time, but I could not find any cut information in the discussion database or in writing, nor were there any cuts recorded in ENPOWER. Unfortunately, the Lotus Notes schedule information for this day is missing. Conagra is charging us $6,625.00 for having to resupply themselves.

"&gt; From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of Adam &gt; L. Beberg&gt;  &gt; If the creator didnt say you could have it without paying, it&#x27;s theft, so &gt; simple, hell that&#x27;s even in all the major holy books.Ran across a site which claimed to explain the original meaning of the Ten Commandments.  It seems some of those meanings have evolved a bit, too.In particular, there was a claim that the commandment on stealing was actually specifically about &#x27;man stealing -- selling a free man into slavery.  Certainly the US southerners were particularly sensitive to the term &#x27;man stealer&#x27; in a way I didn&#x27;t understand.Yep, I know he said all holy books.  No, I don&#x27;t know if this site was blowing hot air.  It just read like someone had done their homework.http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",0,"If the creator did not explicitly grant permission to use their work without compensation, it's considered theft. This principle is not limited to any particular holy book, as it's a fundamental moral imperative.

I recently came across a website that attempted to clarify the original meaning of the Ten Commandments. It's fascinating to see how the interpretations of these commandments have evolved over time. One specific example is the concept of stealing, which, according to this website, was originally intended to prohibit the act of selling a free person into slavery. It's interesting to note that this interpretation resonated particularly strongly with people from the American South, who had a complex relationship with the term ""man stealer.""

While I'm not convinced that this website was entirely accurate in its claims, it's evident that the author put forth a significant effort to understand the subject matter. The website's article reads like a well-researched piece."

They think it&#x27;s a... ,0,"I'd like to share my thoughts on the best UI (User Interface) among Mac OS 9, Mac OS X, and Windows. While opinions are divided, it's interesting to note that Tim O'Reilly, a well-known figure in the tech industry, initially disliked Mac OS 9, but has since come to appreciate Mac OS X. On the other hand, some traditional Mac users are skeptical of the new operating system, deeming it too different from the classic Mac OS 9 design.

Despite these differing opinions, it's clear that each UI has its own strengths and weaknesses. Mac OS 9, for instance, was a more familiar and straightforward environment for traditional Mac users, but it may have lacked some of the modern features and polish of newer operating systems. In contrast, Mac OS X introduced a more contemporary and sleek design, but some users may have initially found it difficult to adapt to the new layout and functionality.

As for Windows, it has its own set of features and design choices, which have likely appealed to some users while alienating others. In conclusion, while the best UI remains a matter of personal preference, it's fascinating to explore the different opinions and experiences people have had with these operating systems."
" Remember when I said that taking an afternoon off to march for Dmitri was pissing in the wind and that to be really effective we needed people willing to publically break the stupid laws right in the face of the authorities?Well it seems Bruce Perens agrees with me, only he&#x27;s going one better, instead of just mouthing off about it, he&#x27;s going to do it and do it  in a big way ...     Open source campaigner to risk jail     By James Middleton [24-07-2002]    Bruce Perens plans live DVD hack    With the dust from the Elcomsoft/Sklyarov case still thick in the     air, influential open source activist Bruce Perens plans to go one     better by breaking the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DCMA)     during a live presentation on Friday.    Fresh from giving RealNetworks a slating for not completely     backing open source with its latest announcement, Perens said that     during a Digital Rights Management presentation to be held Friday     at the O&#x27;Reilly developer conference in San Diego, he would break     the law.    The DMCA has been a sore point in the open source community since     the outlawing of DeCSS, a tool created so that DVDs could be     played on Linux machines, and more recently since the arrest of     Dmitry Sklyarov and the criminal charges faced by his employer,     Elcomsoft.    Based on the recent history of DMCA contravention, Perens could     face imprisonment or a $500,000 fine for his actions.    According to Infoworld the demonstration is to be carried out in     protest at the regional system used by the motion picture industry     to prevent DVDs released in one country being played on machines     in another country.    During his presentation, Perens will demonstrate how to hack a DVD     player so that it can play movies from any region.    &quot;It is a political and social statement, and the statement is that     the people do not need to have a hall monitor living in their     stereo system and should be able to play any kind of media on the     device they wish,&quot; he was quoted as saying.    But luck may be on his side, if last year is anything to go by. At     the same conference in 2001 Perens made a presentation on the     triviality of Digital Rights Management systems using exactly the     same slides that got Sklyarov arrested.http://www.vnunet.com/News/1133862--  Gary Lawrence Murphy  TeleDynamics Communications Inc Business Innovations Through Open Source Systems: http://www.teledyn.com &quot;Computers are useless.  They can only give you answers.&quot;(Pablo Picasso)http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork ",0,"I'd like to reiterate my point that we need more than just symbolic gestures to bring about real change. Instead, we need people willing to take concrete action and face the consequences. Bruce Perens, an open source campaigner, plans to do just that by openly defying the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) during a presentation at the O'Reilly developer conference in San Diego.

Perens' planned demonstration is a bold move, given the risks involved. He'll be showing how to hack a DVD player to play movies from any region, which could result in imprisonment or a $500,000 fine. However, his actions are a powerful statement against the region-based DVD restrictions imposed by the motion picture industry.

Perens' message is clear: people should have the freedom to use their devices as they see fit, without restrictions. His actions are a call to action, encouraging others to join him in breaking the law and demanding change. It's a provocative move, but one that could spark meaningful change in the open source community."

In the book ""History of the Magic of a Common Language"" by Jakobson, Mathesius, Trubetzkoy, and the Prague Linguistic Circle, Jindrich Toman explores the historical factors and tenets of the Prague Linguistic Circle, focusing on the social and cultural environment that shaped the development of linguistics.

Another book, ""Ling Semiotics"" by Yishai Tobin, presents a contrastive study of sign systems in English and Hebrew, examining invariance, markedness, and distinctive feature analysis. The study demonstrates how linguistic forms and constructions, despite being classified similarly, function differently across languages. Tobin argues that semantic domains and features are marked by distinct sets of features, leading to differences in language-specific usage.

In ""Current Issues in Linguistic Theory"", Rosina Lippi-Green contributes to language ideology and language change in early modern German. Her sociolinguistic study of the consonantal system of Nuremberg, based on a computerized corpus, employs multivariate statistical procedures to analyze the interaction of linguistic, social, and stylistic factors on written language variation. The study highlights the quantification of an individual's relationship to language standardization and its impact on written language variation."

As a native speaker of English (New Zealand English), I agree with the points raised by Wayne Lawrence and Marilyn Silva. When considering the sentence, I can only interpret the person being asked as the one required to leave the room. There's an undeniable pragmatic element in both examples, ""The teacher asked the child to leave the room"" and ""The child asked the teacher to leave the room"". In both cases, the teacher is assumed to be in authority, and the child is not. Therefore, [1] immediately evokes a normal situation, while [2] requires a re-interpretation, as ""kids don't do that"" except in special circumstances.

I have to agree with Wayne that the immediate interpretation is that the person being asked is expected to leave. This interpretation is a function of syntax. Only when you consider the syntactically generated interpretation do pragmatic constraints force you to re-evaluate. For me, it's a distinctly two-stage process, with the second stage triggered only if there are issues with the first. In the case of ""John asked Mary to leave"", I believe syntax has it."

To correct some inaccuracies, it was actually Juan Ponce de León who discovered Florida, not Cortez. Moreover, there were never millions of natives in Florida, at least not until recent times.

Cortez never set foot in Florida, as he focused on Mexico and the Aztec Empire. Ponce de León did encounter Indian peoples in Florida, but they remained there until a significant portion of them relocated to Cuba with the Spanish due to an influx of Seminole Indians from the north, brought by the English in the 17th century. The remaining natives likely merged with the new population, died out, or otherwise disappeared, and their culture became extinct."

List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie ",0,"I was considering using the command 'lilo -b /dev/hdb -r /mnt', but I think that '-b' is equivalent to the 'boot' keyword in lilo.conf. Alternatively, will this command simply work automatically? In other words, 'boot = /dev/hda' in lilo.conf instructs lilo what sector numbers to modify and it figures out where the disk is from the '-r' option.

Unfortunately, that approach won't work as you intend. You'll end up with a boot loader on the backup disk that contains the ""physical"" location of the /boot/map file on the main disk, which might not be the same as the backup disk.

I'm struggling to find a suitable solution using LILO. I have a similar setup on my home machine (rsync to a backup disk every night), but I'll have to reinstall RH if I need to perform a disk swap. I'll be pulling out the RH install CDs to resolve the LILO issue.

GRUB, on the other hand, should be able to handle this scenario without issues, as it doesn't record sector numbers like LILO does. Unfortunately, that doesn't provide much help for you.

In the wake of two coordinated attacks in Egypt, a woman identified as Negat Yassin emerged as a key figure. Just over an hour after the initial attack on a tour bus carrying Israeli tourists, Yassin shot and wounded her companion, before taking her own life. The second attack occurred when Yassin, who was said to be a sister of the initial target, attempted to assassinate Egyptian police officials. Her actions were motivated by a desire for revenge following the death of her brother, Khamis.

In the aftermath of the attacks, Egyptian police officials reported the capture of two suspects, Ashraf Saeed Youssef and Gamal Ahmed Abdel Aal, in connection with the initial bus attack. A third suspect, Ehab Youssef Yassin, the brother of Negat Yassin, attempted to evade capture by jumping from a highway overpass, setting off a nail-filled bomb in the process.

The attacks were claimed by two militant groups, the Mujahedeen of Egypt and the Abdullah Azzam Brigades, although the authenticity of these claims could not be verified. Women are not known to have carried out past attacks in Egypt, making Negat Yassin's actions a notable exception. According to Fouad Allam, a"

I've been reviewing recent references on Extreme Value Theory (EVT) and its applications. I'll get back to you shortly with some points on the usefulness of EVT and how traders (electricity and weather) can benefit from it.

Regarding your inquiry, to my knowledge, the research group is primarily examining EVT in the context of Value at Risk calculations. We haven't explored EVT for power applications yet, as we've been focusing on shorter-term fundamental forecasting of price excursions. Specifically, we use load forecasts and expected plant dispatch to predict which lines will become constrained and how the system will react to alleviate these constraints.

I'd be interested in your thoughts on how EVT can benefit traders. Regarding the weather aspect, I expect the weather desk to use EVT at some level. You may want to discuss this further with Joe Hrgovic, the research chap attached to the weather desk, for a more accurate assessment.

Best regards,

" I have a couple of small issues, and I&#x27;m not sure if their exmh issues or my setup issues.First, when I try and run exmh with wish from tk8.4.0 it seems to take forever to start, but with wish from tk8.a.4 it starts in a snap.Using the latest CVS, when I open exmh and the folder I&#x27;m in has unseen messages and I hit next, exmh changes to the next folder with unseen messages rather than to the first unseen in the current folder.Finally, when I reach the end of the messages in a folder and go on to the next unseen, exmh always goes back to inbox (which has no unseen messages) rather than the next folder with unseen messages.

I'm writing to report a few issues I've encountered while using exmh, and I'm not sure if they're related to my setup or the program itself. I'd appreciate your insight into these problems.

The first issue I've noticed is that exmh takes a long time to start when I use the wish shell from tk8.4.0, whereas it starts quickly when I use the wish shell from tk8.a.4.

When I open exmh and navigate to a folder with unseen messages, and then click ""Next"", exmh changes to the next folder with unseen messages, rather than the first unseen message in the current folder. This behavior seems inconsistent with my expectations.

When I reach the end of the messages in a folder and move on to the next unseen message, exmh always returns to the inbox (which, of course, has no unseen messages). Instead, I would expect it to go to the next folder with unseen messages. Interestingly, when I click ""Next"" from the inbox, exmh behaves as I would expect.

I wanted to bring these issues to your attention and find out if I'm expecting something different than I should be. Any insights you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your hard work on"

I've been noticing that my Debian setup allows for a feature that's not available on my Red Hat boxes. I'd like to bring this to your attention. I've discovered a fascinating project called Falconseye, which seems to be a graphical interface to the game Nethack. You can access the website at http://falconseye.sourceforge.net/.

I've noticed that the RPM files provided on the website are compatible with RH7.3, based on NH3.x, which was previously included in RH7.1's powertools. This feature is, of course, apt-compatible. Additionally, the RPM also includes Text-Iconv, which is a nice bonus.

One minor issue I've encountered is that the GPG key was not immediately available, even though vendors.list lists the key IDs. However, I was able to resolve this by accessing the key at /apt/vs.key.asc.

Thanks for bringing this to my attention, and I hope you can help clarify this discrepancy between Debian and Red Hat.

In fact, you can go get the sources for, say, GNU&#x27;s /bin/true, compile it yourself and try selling the resulting binary for EUR 1000.  (And, with a good enough sales pitch, you just might get away with it!)However, what the GPL does stipulate is that you must  provide the sources for that binary if asked.  So I might buy it from you for EUR 1000, compile it myself and sell that binary for EUR 1.  Of course, I&#x27;ll need to provide the sources to anyone that asks as well.  But, I just might make money at this, since there might be a market of 10000 people who would pay 1 euro for the convenience of getting a binary.But then, John Looney would step in, buy it from me for 1 euro, burn it and the sources and some of his favourite /bin/true patches on a CD and duplicate it for the cost of the media or a cream bun, depending on how hungry he is.You see, the GPL doesn&#x27;t force the binaries to be zero-cost (or cost-of-media), but it puts a really big hole in any business plan that solely resells GPL software.  You _can_ charge for it if you want, but you bloody well better be providing some value for that money, or you&#x27;ll go out of business faster than a dot-com in 2001.And there are real ways to provide this value for money (convenience of getting it on one CD, convenience of a friendly installer, convenience of vendor-supplied updates, convenience of having what lots of other people have, posting a CD and paying a few euro is cheaper than downloading over a modem, warm fuzzy feeling of getting something from a &quot;real&quot; company, etc).There will be segments of the market that will pay various amounts for GPL software and there will be others that don&#x27;t. Thankfully, the GPL allows for both, _by_design_.

If you believe the GNU General Public License (GPL) grants you the right to obtain free software, you are mistaken. The GPL does not provide for free software. 

My impression was that all you needed to do was pay for the media and not the code itself, but that is not the case. According to the GPL, if you have lawfully received a copy of the covered binary version, you have the right to also receive the matching source code.

The GPL makes no requirements regarding the cost of binaries. In fact, you can obtain the sources for a program like GNU's /bin/true, compile it yourself, and sell the resulting binary for any amount you choose. However, the GPL does stipulate that you must provide the sources for that binary if someone requests them. 

This means that while you can sell binaries, you must also provide the sources to anyone who asks. This can make it difficult to create a business model based solely on reselling GPL software, as the market will always be able to access the sources for free.

There are ways to provide value to customers when selling GPL software, such as offering a convenient installer, vendor-supplied updates, or a CD with the software and its sources. There will always be segments of the"

The defense system is designed for operations in low Earth orbit (LEO) and is effective against smaller targets through kinetic kill or nearby nuclear detonation.

However, a 100 MT warhead would not fragment the target significantly, as it would be too slow to vaporize it in the few seconds left before impact. Even if the target was vaporized, there would still be an impact on the Earth's energy balance, affecting the atmosphere rather than the lithosphere or hydrosphere.

This principle is essential to our American system. To emphasize, the absence of proof does not prove the absence of taxes. In fact, refusing to acknowledge authority without using strong arguments is ineffective. The concept of using two feet, or taking bold action, is crucial when challenging established norms. As we consider tax policies, it's vital to focus on the principle of taxation being based on one's ability to pay. This approach is not only fair but also promotes social justice. I believe this principle is at the heart of our American values, and I encourage us to uphold it as we move forward."

We are ready to release the different versions of vatrfacs code, developed by Jin over the last half year. The recent developments include:

* Weighting log-returns with an exponential decay factor when calculating correlations
* Calculating factors and correlations for UK curves
* Joint estimation of factor loadings for selected groups of commodities
* An alternative method for collecting historical data for correlation calculations (based on fixed contracts instead of collecting prompt, prompt + 1, etc. prices)

Before releasing these developments, we need to have each version under ClearCase. Then, we will:
* Run vatrfacs code in the stage environment (which has been refreshed recently)
* Run var code in the stage and validate the results

It is time to start releasing these four versions, with projects 3 and 4 requiring some experimental runs in the stage. A few traders in the gas, power, and liquids markets are expecting the results.

Additionally, the following developments have been suggested by research, approved by risk control, and submitted as spreadsheet prototypes, waiting in line:
* Volatility blending for intramonth power positions
* Forward volatility smoothing and extracting forward forward volatilities

If I had to buy a piece of property, I'd want to ensure I had clear ownership. Unfortunately, there are many reasons why people can't own land. In some cases, it's because it's government land, and you need an army of lawyers to convert it. In other cases, original owners didn't have the right to subdivide, but they did it anyway. Interestingly, in Japan, it was a death sentence to sell land for centuries, but they sold it and kept records.

In the US, we eventually integrated squatters and adverse possession into our official law. Mr. Long, I think you'd particularly enjoy the De Soto work.

In the Philippines, it takes 20 years to get legal title. In Egypt, about 80% of the population in Cairo lives in places where they are officially illegal. People squat on land without owning it due to the desire for jobs. For people to buy their own land, capitalism must be healthy but not triumphant.

- The major landowners in India before independence were relatively well-off. In the US, we're not too friendly to our capitalists, and adverse possession only takes 5 years. We owe a lot to our frontiers, and didn't Egypt pretty much invent geometry"

"&quot;the historical record&quot;, by which you mean *human* historical record, is highly overrated (nigh worthless) when you are talking about geological timescales, even on topics with as short a timescale as climate.My problem with global warming (or cooling for that matter), is that the supposedly profound recent changes in temperature, both in absolute terms and as a function time, very arguably fall well below the noise floor of the natural fluctuations that have occurred over the last 50,000 years both in terms of absolute average temperature and the rate of temperature change.  People unfamiliar with history of global temperature since the advent of modern humans may think that a degree here or there over a century is a lot, not realizing that global temperatures regularly whipsaw with far greater extremity.  I therefore  immediately dismiss any theory of global warming that cannot explain why temperatures whipsawed more severely in pre-history than in the last couple thousand years (which have been relatively calm by geological standards).  This is a very inconvenient fact for people trying to use climate to push a particular social agenda.It is worth noting that underneath the receding glaciers deposited during the last major ice age, they are finding substantial evidence of humans living in what was a nice temperate climate before the glaciers paved over their civilization.  The receding glaciers have turned into a bit of an archaeological treasure chest, as they expose artifacts buried in and underneath them as they shrink that have been preserved by the ice for thousands of years.  I don&#x27;t see any compelling reason to &quot;save the glaciers&quot; anyway, particularly in light of the fact that their existence has always been transient.For anyone to insist that the current negligible fluctuations are anthropogenic just heaps one ridiculous assertion upon another.  I&#x27;ll just stick with Occam&#x27;s Razor for now.In my humble opinion.Cheers,-James Rogers  jamesr@best.com On Mon, 2002-09-23 at 12:23, Jim Whitehead wrote: &gt;  &gt; For anyone to fully bury global warming, they would need to explain why the &gt; dramatic increase in CO2 concentrations are not increasing the global &gt; temperature.

That is, &gt; people need more than refutations, they need a compelling alternate &gt; explanation (hint: climate variability doesn&#x27;t cover all the bases).",0,"I would like to discuss the notion of global warming. When considering geological timescales, I believe it's essential to acknowledge that the human historical record is often misleading. The recent changes in global temperature, both in absolute terms and over time, are arguably dwarfed by natural fluctuations that have occurred over the past 50,000 years. The noise floor of these fluctuations is so high that even the most recent changes may be insignificant.

I'm skeptical of theories attributing global warming to human activities because they don't adequately explain why temperatures were more extreme in the past. Moreover, I'm not convinced that the receding glaciers are a significant issue, as they have always been transient and have unearthed substantial evidence of human civilizations in the past.

Rather than relying on hypothetical assertions, I think it's more logical to consider the geological evidence and Occam's Razor. In my opinion, there's no compelling reason to assume that current fluctuations are anthropogenic.

The authors demonstrate that each complement form carries meaning, which can be expressed in terms of the cognitive organization it represents, and that the distribution of these forms is determined by the semantic compatibility between main verbs. The book proposes a solution that departs from existing analyses in three major ways, accounting for form and distribution, positing no construction-specific devices, and providing a global understanding of complementation by treating various constructions in similar ways."

I'm writing to clarify a point regarding the attention given to methodological issues in linguistics, particularly in regards to establishing very distant linguistic relationships like Nostratic. As you may know, Language magazine has not published a review of Illich-Svitych's books, despite a scholar agreeing to review them. However, research in the same tradition has been reviewed in our journal. For instance, Bernard Comrie's review of Starostin's book on Altaic and Japanese was published in Language 69:828-832 (1993). The methodological issues involved in the Altaic and Japanese case are similar to those in the Nostratic case.

I'm puzzled by the open-letter signers' apparent belief that the Russian approach to these issues has received no attention in Language. If there's any further discussion or clarification needed, please feel free to reach out.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to you in the hope that we can establish a business relationship. I came across your contact information through my research on the internet, and I am reaching out to you with a simple and sincere business proposition.

Unfortunately, my family has been faced with a series of unfortunate events. My father, Mr. Coulibaly Bakar, was a wealthy cocoa merchant who was poisoned to death by his business associates during a business meeting. After my mother's passing, my father took me under his wing and entrusted me with a significant amount of money, approximately US$16,500,000. He used my name as the next of kin in the account, and I am the sole beneficiary.

As his only child, my father confided in me that he was afraid for my safety, considering the circumstances surrounding his death. He wanted me to seek a foreign partner to assist me in transferring the funds and utilizing them for investment purposes. I believe your expertise and guidance would be invaluable in this process.

Specifically, I am seeking your assistance in the following areas:

1. Providing a bank account where I can transfer the funds.
2. Acting as the guardian of the funds, as I am still young and inexperienced.
3. Making"

Hi All,

The modem handshake functions at higher speeds (up to 57,600 bps), but that's not suitable for transmitting data to the remote server at the pace of 1,200 bps. The remote server insists on communicating at a slow speed. It seems that the flow control is set to Xon/Xoff instead of hardware-based.

The modem configuration is set to 1,200 bps, 7 data bits, and even parity. This is unusual, as 8-n-1 is more common. I reset the modem by sending an ATZ3 command, followed by the initialization string:

AT&F1E1V1Q0X4Y0S32=232&A1&B0&C1&D2&H0&I0&K1&M4&N0&P0&R1&S0&U0&Y1

I believe the AT command for hardware flow control is &E4, although this may vary depending on the modem model.

Best regards,
Colin Nevin"

What can wordplay - - as understood in the broadest sense - - teach us about language, its functions, characteristics, structure, and workings? Using Lewis Carroll's Alice as a starting point, Yaguello takes the reader on a vivid and unconventional voyage into the world(s) of language, charting the major themes of linguistics along the way. This is an entertaining and original introduction to the nature of language that will appeal to students and teachers alike.

In this book, we explore the major issues of linguistics, including the nature of language, its structure, and its use. We delve into the world of language, examining the ways in which language is used to communicate, and the ways in which it is shaped by the cultures and societies in which it is used. We also explore the ways in which language is influenced by social, cultural, and historical factors, and the ways in which it is used as a tool for power and control.

The book is organized around the themes of language, culture, and society, and includes discussions of key concepts such as language contact, multilingualism, and linguistic imperialism. It is a comprehensive and authoritative introduction to the field of linguistics, and is designed to be accessible to students and teachers at all"
"Dan Kohn  writes:&gt; Guys, the Habeas Infringers List (HIL) exists explicitly to deal with &gt; spammers while we&#x27;re getting judgments against them and especially in &gt; other countries, where those judgments are harder to get.My concern doesn&#x27;t stem from failing to understand how your business is intended to work.  My concern is the lack of empirical evidence that it will reduce the amount of uncaught spam.&gt; Please note that nobody has ever had an incentive before to go after &gt; regular spammers.  Yes, some attorneys general have prosecuted blatant &gt; pyramid schemes, and ISPs have won some theft of service suits, but &gt; the vast majority of spammers go forward with out any legal hassles. &gt; So, I can&#x27;t understand how Daniel can assert that you can&#x27;t track &gt; spammers down when it&#x27;s never really been tried.Please don&#x27;t misquote me.  I did not assert that you &quot;can&#x27;t track spammers&quot;.  Here is what I said:| It will be difficult to find, prosecute, and win money from someone in | various non-friendly countries where spam originates (China is a good | example) even if they do officially &quot;respect&quot; copyright law.I understand the incentive that you have to pursue spammers, but that does not directly translate to less spam being sent to my inbox.  It is an indirect effect and the magnitude of the effect may not be sufficient to counteract the ease with which a -20 score on the mark allows spam to avoid being tagged as spam.&gt; Daniel, it&#x27;s easy enough for you to change the Habeas scores yourself &gt; on your installation.  If Habeas fails to live up to its promise to &gt; only license the warrant mark to non-spammers and to place all &gt; violators on the HIL, then I have no doubt that Justin and Craig will &gt; quickly remove us from the next release.  But, you&#x27;re trying to kill &gt; Habeas before it has a chance to show any promise.I think I&#x27;ve worked on SA enough to understand that I can localize a score.  I&#x27;m just not comfortable with using SpamAssassin as a vehicle for drumming up your business at the expense of our user base.I think it would make more sense to start Habeas with a less aggressive score (one which will not give spammers a quick path into everyone&#x27;s inbox) and after we&#x27;ve seen evidence that the system works, then we can increase the magnitude of the score.Dan ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven. http://thinkgeek.com/sf _______________________________________________ Spamassassin-talk mailing list Spamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk",0,"Hi team,

I'd like to discuss my concerns regarding the Habeas Infringers List (HIL) and its potential to reduce spam. While I understand how the business model works, I'm unsure if it will actually make a significant impact. My concern is that there's a lack of empirical evidence demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing spam.

Historically, spammers have operated without legal consequences, and it's unclear how the HIL will change this. I'm not questioning the incentive to pursue spammers, but rather the indirect effect this may have on the amount of spam received.

I also worry that the HIL's design may lead to spam avoiding being tagged as spam. Daniel, you have the capability to adjust the Habeas scores yourself. If the HIL fails to meet its promises, I'm confident that Justin and Craig will remove us from the next release.

I propose starting with a less aggressive score and gathering evidence that the system works before increasing its magnitude. This approach would allow us to test and refine the HIL's effectiveness before introducing more aggressive measures.

Please let me know your thoughts on this matter.

Best regards,
Dan Kohn"

Call for Papers: Workshop on Constraints and Preferences at PLM '99

The Poznan Linguistic Meeting (PLM) is pleased to announce a call for papers for a workshop on constraints and preferences, to be held during PLM '99, the 32nd Poznan Linguistic Meeting. The workshop will explore recent developments in linguistic theory, with a focus on the epistemological compatibility of constraints and preferences.

The workshop aims to examine various aspects of constraints and preferences, including:

* The nature of both constraints and preferences, and their relationship
* The scalar nature of preferences versus the absolute nature of constraints
* Hierarchy versus rule order
* Constraints versus rules/processes
* The predictive and explanatory power of constraints and preferences
* Constraints/preferences and online processing
* The learnability problem
* Pro/contra parallelisms between diachronic change and synchronic rules/processes
* Phonological and phonetic constraints, with illustrations and empirical evidence

Confirmed speakers include:

* Wolfgang U. Dressler (Vienna)
* Rajendra Singh (Montreal)
* Nikolaus Ritt (Vienna)
* Martin Prinzhorn (Vienna)

Abstracts should be submitted in one-page format to dkasia@ifa.amu.edu.pl"

However, kernel-source and kernel-headers are specifically listed in the ""HoldPkgs"" section, which means they will not be installed, even if they would normally be duplicates. On the other hand, the kernel package itself is not included in the ""HoldPkgs"" list, so it should still be installed if it's not already present.

I understand your concern about testing this on a clean system, but if you're interested in verifying the behavior, you can try installing apt and apt.conf as you would on a vanilla system. If everything is set up correctly, you should see the kernel package installed, while kernel-source and kernel-headers are held back.

"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85534626 Date: Not suppliedAfter discovering an open wireless net available from his sofa, Steven  &quot;Hackers&quot; Levy interviewed lawmen, academics and WiFi activists about the  legality and ethics of using open wireless access points.     I downloaded my mail and checked media news on the Web. When I confessed      this to FBI agent Bill Shore, he spared the handcuffs. &quot;The FBI wouldn&#x27;t      waste resources on that,&quot; he sniffed. Now I know that if it did, it would      be hard to argue that I broke a law. What&#x27;s more, I certainly didn&#x27;t feel      illegal.

I'd like to share my experience about using open wireless access points. After discovering a nearby network, I interviewed experts from law enforcement, academia, and WiFi activism about the legality and ethics of accessing these points. As I browsed the web, I checked my email and news media using this free service. When I confessed to FBI agent Bill Shore, he surprisingly didn't take any action. He told me that the FBI wouldn't waste resources on such a case, implying that I hadn't broken any law. This experience led me to realize that if the FBI did take action, it would be challenging to argue that I committed a crime. Moreover, I didn't feel guilty about using this resource. This is the point of all the discussions about war-driving, chalking, and node-stumbling: when you get accustomed to wireless connectivity, it begins to feel like a fundamental right. In the future, we may come to view bandwidth as essential as air, making it absurd to argue that it's illegal."

Regarding the storage deals 47472 and 60747, I would like to confirm that we should be using contract number 60747, which is an interruptible storage deal, instead of contract number 47472, which is a firm storage deal.

Are there any reasons not to use the new apt releases on RH 7.x?

Upon considering the new apt releases, I'm having trouble finding any drawbacks. My main concern, however, is that when rebuilding packages for Psyche on Valhalla, I would need to adjust the ""Release:"" tag to ensure upgrade compatibility. This would complicate my CVS repository, which is hosted on my Valhalla box. 

I understand there are workarounds for this issue, but the simplest solution for me would be to wait until I upgrade my primary machine to Psyche and have Valhalla on a secondary rebuild system.

I am reaching out to discuss the software options available for our team. As you know, we are currently using Adobe Photoshop on Windows machines, and we are satisfied with its performance. However, we are exploring alternative solutions that can provide us with better value for our budget.

Our current usage of Photoshop is focused primarily on graphic design and image editing. We have also been utilizing Microsoft Office for word processing, spreadsheet management, and presentation purposes. As we forecast our budget for the upcoming quarter, we are looking for cost-effective solutions that can help us streamline our workflow.

After conducting some research, we are considering other alternatives that offer similar functionality at a lower cost. We are particularly interested in exploring the possibility of using open-source or free versions of Photoshop, which we believe can provide us with the necessary tools without breaking the bank.

In the meantime, we will continue to use our current software and ensure a smooth transition to any new solutions. If you have any recommendations or insights on the matter, please do not hesitate to share them with us.

I wanted to reiterate the importance of addressing certain aspects of your life. Specifically, I believe it's crucial to prioritize your physical well-being, particularly in regards to your penile health. There are some fantastic resources available online that can help you increase your penis size by up to 20% in just a few weeks.

I also wanted to share some insightful quotes with you. The Greeks are known for their contributions to logic, but they were not naive enough to be deceived by it. Fear is often a more reliable motivator than love, and being unable to control your impulses can be a hallmark of youthful immaturity.

Lastly, I wanted to point out that even the strictest laws can sometimes do more harm than good. It's essential to consider the unintended consequences of our actions.

I wanted to share an observation I made while browsing the archives. Despite being a frequent reader, I noticed something that caught my attention and I had not noticed before. Specifically, I noticed that I sometimes struggle to differentiate between ""new"" and ""knew"" in my typing, and it's not uncommon for me to get the two words mixed up.

As a side note, I'm aware of the correct differences between the two words and usually get it right. However, when I'm typing quickly, the distinction between ""new"" and ""knew"" tends to blur.

I just thought I'd share this tiny observation and see if anyone else has experienced something similar.

I spent some time researching the topic of meritocracy, specifically focusing on its relevance to management issues within a large organization. I have to say, I was underwhelmed by the results. It seems that everyone has their own definition of meritocracy, and much of the information I found was not directly applicable to business.

Despite the lack of concrete benchmarks, I managed to gather some information that I believe is relevant to the Enron culture. I've attached some slides to your presentation, which you can edit as needed. I plan on stopping by a bookstore tomorrow evening to further expand my knowledge on this topic. I also need to film our PRC video today, so I'll be a bit busy.

Hi Louise,

I wanted to bring to your attention that the recent reorganization of the front and back office groups has made it challenging for me to keep track of the key individuals involved in various systems. However, I've tried to identify the most critical personnel and estimated the minimum number of additional individuals required to ensure continuity. At the bottom of this email, I've included a list of ""cannot lose"" individuals. These individuals are critical to problem-solving in any system.

I've listed 33 personnel from various groups, including Oracle, SQL Server, and EnronOnline. Some notable mentions include:
- Jay Zhiyong Wei and his team (3) for TAGG and SITARA
- Steve Nat and his team (2) for ENPOWER
- G. Ramesh and his team (1) for credit aggregation/risk analytics
- Sundar Chitradurga and his team (1) for Global Systems
- Ramesh Rao and his team (5) for Unify
- Jim Ogg and his team (3) for Oracle
- Mike Belmont, Mike Guadarrama, Francesc Gullien, Jarod Jenson, Bob Hillier, Kenneth Lim, and Dan Harrell for front and"
