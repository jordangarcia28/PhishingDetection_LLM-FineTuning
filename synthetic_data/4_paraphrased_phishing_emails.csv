Muddied my ass.  How hard is it to &gt;&gt;chose between a Republocrat or a Demipublican?   Not very.  Shouting &gt;&gt;down has grown to become the answer because the government, over a &gt;&gt;span of years, and with the help of the Courts -has- limited the &gt;&gt;rights we have as citizens under the First Amendment. &gt;&gt;     &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;Wishful thinking. People are just bigger dickheads now. Culture is changing &gt;and it is becoming acceptable to get in peoples face and shout them down &gt;when you disagree with them.  The people that do this are NOT &gt;disenfranchised. They &gt;get their rocks off on being disagreeable assholes. The act of protesting is &gt;more important than the actual issue being protested for most of these &gt;people. &gt;   &gt; In my experience, this is classic &quot;American&quot; behaviour, and I don&#x27;t  think its on the increase outside of the US of A. I am willing to accept the premise that Americans are bigger dickheads  then they used to be.Owen",0,"I'm concerned that today's political climate has led to a normalization of aggressive behavior at political rallies. The courts have consistently ruled that there are limits to the first amendment, and I believe this has contributed to the widespread practice of shouting down opponents. Instead of engaging in respectful dialogue, many people have adopted the tactic of drowning out opposing viewpoints. This is not only unproductive but also intimidates those with opposing views from expressing themselves.

It's frustrating that the political system has become so polarized that individuals feel the need to resort to these tactics. I agree that the government, with the help of the courts, has limited our rights as citizens under the first amendment, and this has created a sense of disillusionment among the public.

However, I also believe that cultural shifts play a significant role in this behavior. The rise of social media and the 24-hour news cycle have created an environment where people are more likely to engage in heated discussions and become embroiled in conflict. Unfortunately, this has led to a culture of aggression and disrespect, rather than civil discourse.

It's crucial that we recognize this trend and strive to create a society where our differences are addressed through respectful and constructive dialogue. We must also hold our leaders accountable for promoting a culture of civility"

The idea is that the end user can create a rule that moves the spam-flagged messages into a spam folder, thereby gaining some time by presorting messages into separate piles. If the user is not familiar enough with filtering on actual scores, they have the ""stars"" at their disposal, which provide more than enough options if they choose to use them."

I'd like to revisit the scenario you described, where you signed up for a free account on a website that provides access to a large compilation of data and, consequently, subscribed to their mailing list.

In this context, you're receiving periodic emails with new article links, book recommendations, and other related content. However, these emails are consistently being flagged as spam by Razor, despite your explicit consent to receive them. This raises concerns about the reliability of the trust system in accurately identifying the legitimacy of these emails.

As the recipient of this content, you're understandably frustrated, as you're not benefiting from these emails and would like to opt-out. Moreover, since these emails are not unsolicited commercial emails, they should not be reported as spam by Razor. This issue affects not only your trust rating but also the overall integrity of the system.

I'd like to request clarification on how Razor handles such situations. What measures can be taken to ensure that legitimate, user-subscribed content like this isn't incorrectly reported as spam? Your feedback would be greatly appreciated in maintaining the trustworthiness of the Razor system."

this has worked for me marrow enemy i think there is a world market for maybe five computers . - thomas watson ( 1874 - 1956 ) ; chairman of ibm ; 1943 your highness ; i have no need of this hypothesis . - pierre laplace ( 1749 - 1827 ) ; to napoleon on why his works on celestial mechanics make no mention of god . you got to be careful if you dont know where youre going ; because you might not get there . - yogi berra,1,"

When I first discovered the potential for a global market for a certain number of computers, I was reminded of Thomas Watson's words in 1943: ""This has worked for me; I think there is a world market for maybe five computers."" His statement resonated with me, as I too believed that the demand for computers transcended geographical boundaries. The thought of a small yet significant number of computers being in high demand across the globe was both exciting and daunting. 

As I reflect on the words of Pierre Laplace, who famously told Napoleon that his theories on celestial mechanics did not require the involvement of a deity, I am reminded to be cautious when charting my own course. ""You got to be careful if you don't know where you're going,"" as Yogi Berra wisely said, ""because you might not get there."" In a world where uncertainty is ever-present, I must carefully consider my goals and the potential outcomes before embarking on a journey.

I must admit that the prospect of capitalizing on this global demand for computers is both thrilling and intimidating. However, I believe that with careful planning and an open mind, I can successfully navigate the challenges and seize the opportunities that lie ahead."

Good morning!

I wanted to reach out to update you on the latest developments at MailPound. When we launched our platform almost two years ago, our primary focus was on providing a resource for travel agents to organize and search supplier special offers, as well as participate in our weekly sweepstakes and fam section. However, as the industry has evolved, we've had to adapt and expand our offerings to better serve travel agents and help them succeed in today's challenging economic climate.

Like many in the retail travel industry, we've faced the cumulative effects of commission cuts, the aftermath of 9/11, and the drop in the stock market. To survive and thrive, we're working harder, smarter, and together. Our focus has shifted from simply providing a resource for searching supplier special offers to offering a suite of tools and services that can create sales and raise commissions.

These services, which are supplier-supported and free to travel agents, include features like personalized websites, higher commissions through consolidation, sales incentives, and new technology for fast and easy online bookings. We invite you to visit our website at www.mailpound.com to learn more and discover how our free services can help you succeed.

"find cheap prescriptions on the internet pharmacy ! viagra online now no machine can replace the human spark : spirit , compassion , love and understanding . we should live our lives as though christ were coming this afternoon . love will enter cloaked in friendship &#x27; s name .",1,"
I want to bring attention to the importance of finding affordable prescription options online. With the rising cost of healthcare, it's essential that we explore cost-effective solutions. 

Our current predicament is a stark reminder of how much we rely on technology to perform tasks efficiently. Similarly, I believe that even though machines can do many things well, they can never replace the emotional intelligence and compassion that humans possess.

I recently came across a quote that resonated deeply with me: ""We should live our lives as though Christ were coming this afternoon."" This quote emphasizes the importance of living life with intention and purpose, rather than putting things off until tomorrow.

In a world that often prioritizes technology over human connection, I believe that love is what brings us together. As the quote mentions, ""love will enter cloaked in friendship's name."" I hope that we can all strive to cultivate a sense of love, compassion, and understanding in our daily interactions.

Let's work together to explore affordable prescription options and cultivate a culture of love and kindness."

Currently, I use fetchmail to batch messages, which results in a 0.4-second delay for every message in a typical batch of 50 messages. To improve this, I was wondering if there's a way to process an entire mailbox at once, rather than individually. I understand that you may have been looking for the `-u` flag, which is related to this requirement. 

If memory is not a concern, using the pickle store might provide better performance since it only needs to write to disk once.

I understand you're looking for discussion groups related to the philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, and other kindred philosophical subjects. To clarify, you're seeking resources or groups where participants can engage in discussions on these topics.

Are the group participants familiar with any online forums, social media groups, or specialized mailing lists where such discussions take place? Alternatively, is there a central hub or ""phone book"" that provides an exhaustive list of discussion groups and resources?

Please share any information you may have on this matter, and I'll be happy to help facilitate the discussion.

Dear IonaandR,

I am excited to share an incredible opportunity that could lead to financial success and a more balanced life for you and your family. Our business is not multi-level marketing, and I would like to present you with a few questions to determine if this opportunity is right for you.

Do you already have a home office set up with the necessary equipment, such as a personal computer, fax, and answering machine? If so, this business could be a great fit for you.

Do you have 10-15 hours per week to dedicate to building your own part-time (or full-time) business? If you can commit to this, our system can help you generate a significant cash flow.

Are you comfortable reading from a script and introducing our products with enthusiasm? Our system does all the selling for you, so no cold-calling is required. In fact, prospects will ask you to call them.

With our system, on average, every 15 or 16 calls you make will generate a sale that pays you a commission in excess of $1,100. If you can make that many calls per week (or per day), you can create a substantial income.

If you answered ""yes"" to any of these questions and have integrity,"

I noticed that you updated Radio.root after fixing the double-decoding bug in the aggregator yesterday. Is that correct?

I wanted to share some updates and new resources that I found interesting. Shelley Powers has released RDF Query-o-matic Light, which I've used to explain the power of RDF querying. Meanwhile, Mac OS X Hints has a guide on converting Windows Outlook mail to Mail.app. If you need help with database refactoring, Scott Ambler's essay on the process is a great read.

I also came across a plugin called Sanitize, which cleans HTML and other markup in comment entries. Additionally, Bill Kearney's RDF.root tool can be used to produce RSS-1.0 XML feeds in Radio Userland.

Let me know if you have any questions or need help with anything.

Dear Hiring Managers,

As we continue to improve our hiring process, we would like to remind you of a few key steps that will accelerate the time it takes to make an offer to our candidate. Please note that all applicants must complete and sign an application and Fair Credit Reporting Act form, which is included with the application, prior to being interviewed.

You have the flexibility to have the applicant fill out the form before the interview or direct them to the 36th floor to complete the forms before the interview. Additionally, if you are interviewing an external candidate who is a former Enron employee, please notify Hector Mcloughlin or Frank DeJesus.

All Enron employees will be reviewed by HR and Sally Beck prior to being invited to interview. This process aims to eliminate re-hiring poor performers and ensure a more effective selection process.

When making an offer to a candidate for a management position, please include Sally Beck in the process for input. As a final step, Sally would like to meet with the candidate if time allows or conduct a phone interview as an alternative. Sally's involvement should occur after you have identified the candidate as a potential management new hire.

Thank you for your cooperation in this process. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate"

"summary : chomsky on letting the theory choose i recently asked where it was that chomsky said that in unclear cases we should let the theory choose the right analysis . the answer , supplied by jan odijk , barbara abbott , and michael israel ( to all of whom my thanks ) turns out to be syntactic structures , p . 14 : . . . in order to set the aims of grammar significantly it is sufficient to assume a partial knowledge of sentences and non-sentences . that is , we may assume for this discussion that certain sequences of phonemes are definitely sentences , and that certain others sequences are definitely non-sentences . in many intermediate cases we shall be prepared to let the grammar itself decide , when the grammar is set up in the simplest way so that it includes the clear sentences and excludes the clear non-sentences . . . . a certain number of clear cases , then will provide us with a criterion of adequacy for any particular grammar .",0,"I recently came across an interesting quote by Chomsky that I would like to discuss. In unclear cases, where the analysis is not immediately apparent, Chomsky suggests that we should ""let the theory choose"" the correct analysis. I was curious to know where he made this statement, and I appreciate the help I received from Jan Odiijk, Barbara Abbott, and Michael Israel.

According to Chomsky, in Syntactic Structures (p. 14), we can establish the goals of grammar by assuming a partial understanding of sentences and non-sentences. This allows us to consider certain phoneme sequences as definitely sentences and others as definitely non-sentences. In cases where the analysis is uncertain, we should allow the grammar to decide, provided it is set up in the simplest way to include clear sentences and exclude clear non-sentences.

With a sufficient number of clear cases, we can establish a criterion of adequacy for any given grammar. I would like to explore this concept further and discuss its implications in more detail."

I've been experiencing an issue with the `apt-get upgrade` command on my system. When I run the command, it prompts me to install the `libusb` package, even though I already have the same version installed.

california prices have fun !,0,"I wanted to inform you that due to the recent price surge in California, our company has had to adjust its budget for the upcoming project. As you know, we have been planning to launch a new product in the state, and we are now facing higher costs for production materials.

The increase in prices is primarily driven by supply chain disruptions and increased labor costs. We are working closely with our suppliers to negotiate better rates, but in the meantime, we need to adjust our estimates.

Our team has recalculated the project's budget, and we have identified areas where we can make some adjustments. We plan to reduce the scope of certain features and optimize our production process to minimize the impact of the increased costs.

I want to assure you that we are committed to delivering a high-quality product within the original timeline. Our team is working diligently to ensure that the project stays on track, despite the challenges posed by the price surge.

I would like to schedule a meeting with you to discuss the project's budget and timeline in more detail. Please let me know a convenient time for you, and I will arrange the meeting accordingly."

Dear valued customer,

I'm writing to bring to your attention the publication of ""The Phonology of Campidanian Sardinian"" by Roberto Bolognesi. This groundbreaking book presents a comprehensive description and theoretical account of the phonological system of Southern Sardinian, a self-organizing structure that is based on three existing theories: the dependency-based approach to segmental structure, metrical prosody, and optimality theory.

The book is divided into ten chapters, covering topics such as sociolinguistic introduction, data presentation, theoretical introduction, and more. It provides a unitary framework that leads to a comprehensive account of the phonological system, from the segmental level to the level of higher prosodic constituents.

A major revision and extension of the three theories are proposed, resulting in a new understanding of the phonological system of Southern Sardinian. The book is an essential read for anyone interested in phonology, linguistics, and language theory.

If you're interested in purchasing the book, please note that the price for individuals ordering directly from Holland Academic Graphics is NLG 40 (excluding P&P and VAT). You can place your order at their website or contact them directly.

Thank you for your attention, and I hope you find"

Advanced Micro Devices is doing it. Microsoft is doing      it.     Apple Computer isn&#x27;t.     What&#x27;s Apple not doing? It&#x27;s not -- at least so far -- moving toward an      anti-customer embrace with Hollywood&#x27;s movie studios and the other members      of the powerful entertainment cartel.  Link[1] Discuss[2][1] http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/business/columnists/4193839.htm [2] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/LhvQTmDf6wi ,0,"
As the entertainment industry launches a campaign against general-purpose computing, major tech companies are reluctantly giving in. Intel, AMD, and Microsoft have all yielded to the pressure, but Apple is taking a different approach. In his recent column, Dan Gillmor highlights Apple's refusal to join the anti-consumer trend. While other companies are moving to limit the flexibility of their products, Apple remains committed to preserving the functionality that users have come to expect.

Intel, AMD, and Microsoft have all signed onto the entertainment industry's efforts to limit the capabilities of their products, effectively restricting the way users can engage with their devices. Apple, on the other hand, has yet to join this movement. In a recent column, Dan Gillmor argues that Apple's stance is a refreshing departure from the anti-consumer stance adopted by other major tech companies.

Gillmor references a recent article in the Silicon Valley Business Journal, which notes the trend towards restricting the capabilities of consumer products. He also points to a discussion forum where users are sharing their concerns about the implications of this trend.

In contrast, Apple is taking a more user-centric approach. By refusing to yield to the pressure from the entertainment industry, Apple is demonstrating its commitment to preserving the flexibility and functionality of its products.

It seems that some individuals tend to focus solely on their own interests, neglecting the well-being of those around them. This self-centered approach is, in my opinion, utter nonsense. Who would wish to disregard the concerns of others and prioritize their own needs above all else? I firmly believe in the importance of liberty, but I also recognize that this freedom should not be exercised at the expense of others. It is essential to strike a balance between our personal desires and the needs of those around us.

Academics and scientists have long debated the ethics of genetic engineering. While some may argue that the pursuit of scientific progress is paramount, I believe that we must consider the potential consequences of our actions on society as a whole. It is our responsibility to ensure that our pursuit of knowledge does not come at the expense of others.

I'm reaching out to inquire about low-cost high-quality software options. As Kathy Clara mentioned, it's essential to find reliable and efficient tools without breaking the bank. I understand that many people are on a tight budget, but it's crucial to invest in software that meets our needs.

In our quest for affordable solutions, we often come across software that may not meet our expectations. However, there are some great alternatives that offer excellent quality at a lower price. For instance, some software developers offer discounts for students, non-profits, or small businesses.

It's also essential to consider the long-term costs of software. While an initial low-cost option may seem appealing, it's crucial to think about the potential costs of maintenance, updates, and support.

If you know of any affordable and high-quality software options, please let me know. I'd appreciate any recommendations or insights you can share.

We propose the following modifications to the Senate vacancies procedure: the seats of Senators in the first class will be vacated at the end of the second year, the seats of Senators in the second class will be vacated at the end of the fourth year, and the seats of Senators in the third class will be vacated at the end of the sixth year.

"it was my understanding that they had the food before they refused to pay. I often have the goods in my possession before I settle the paycheck.Second, &#x27;not being paid for a little food&#x27; is an awfully big deal in India. It isn&#x27;t far from stealing the only food my children have so I&#x27;ll have to watch them starve. The margin of survival is very, very, thin.So yes. In my particular reality distortion field &#x27;not paying for a little food&#x27; in India is akin to a direct act of violence intended to cause suffering if not death on the victims family. That such an act triggers a violent response is, IMHO, hardly surprising.In other words, as far as I could tell the people on the train fired the first shot.With all of that said I still don&#x27;t know if this happened or not. Nor do I know for sure that the margin of survival for those Muslim vendors was that thin. &gt; -----Original Message----- &gt; From: Stephen D.

It seems you are evaluating this with a large reality distortion &gt; field. &gt; &gt; If the activists on the train refused to pay for food, then the vendors &gt; shouldn&#x27;t give it to them. And the local police force should be &gt; arresting them. Etc. &gt; &gt; You have to be operating from a particularly primitive point of view, &gt; which obviously was in operation with the participants here, to think &gt; that religious differences or not being paid for a little food (or &gt; taunting!) was even a remote justification for burning a train full of &gt; people alive. &gt; &gt; sdw &gt; &gt; John Hall wrote: &gt; &gt; What I understood was that the activists on the train refused to pay for &gt; &gt; the food and other items they acquired from the Muslim vendors -- then &gt; &gt; taunted them. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That may not be true, but it would put things in a more interesting &gt; &gt; light. Taking food from a small vendor in India and not paying them is &gt; &gt; trying to starve them. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It sounded consistent with the ideas and purpose of the train full of &gt; &gt; activists. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;m rarely an apologist for Muslims anywhere.

Their murderous attack on the &gt; &gt;&gt;train-load of VHP activists at Godhra (with its awful, atavistic &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; echoes &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;of the killings of Hindus and Muslims by the train-load during the &gt; &gt;&gt;partition riots of 1947) played right into the Hindu extremists&#x27; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hands. &gt; &gt; sdw &gt; -- &gt; swilliams@hpti.com http://www.hpti.com &gt; Stephen D. Williams, Senior Technical Director &gt; &gt;",0,"I understand that the activists on the train refused to pay for food and other items they acquired from Muslim vendors, then taunted them. This action is not only unfair but also dangerous, as it can put the lives of these vendors and their families at risk.

In India, the margin of survival is very thin, and denying someone food can be equivalent to stealing from them. The activists' behavior can be seen as a direct act of violence intended to cause suffering and even death.

I agree that the response from the Muslim vendors was extreme, but I can understand why they felt the need to take drastic action after being taunted and not being paid for their goods. Their actions, while unjustifiable, can be seen as a reaction to the unjust treatment they received.

It's important to remember that there are two sides to every story, and we must try to understand the perspectives of all parties involved. I hope that in the future, we can work towards a society where such conflicts can be resolved peacefully."

Hello Exmh-users community,

I've been experiencing issues with GPG since updating from version 1.0.6 to 1.0.7. The upgrade moved the GPG executable from /usr/bin to /usr/local/bin, which I've corrected in my executable path. EXMH now recognizes my GPG installation, and it correctly displays the line ""Check the signature with GnuPG"" next to messages with GPG signatures. However, when I attempt to check the signature, I receive an error message stating that the public key cannot be found.

I've tried searching for any relevant information, but to no avail. I'm seeking guidance on what might be missing or what I might need to do to resolve this issue.

I'd like to inquire if this feature has been discussed before, perhaps rejected, or if someone is already working on implementing it. Alternatively, would the SpamAssassin development team be interested in accepting a contributed smtp-callback patch from my department? While we wouldn't be opposed to making a one-time contribution, we'd prefer to avoid managing and integrating the patch with SpamAssassin in the future.

I'm curious about how this would work on an account where all mail from a specific domain on another server ends up.

Best regards,

"In 1957, a monastery in Thailand was being relocated and a group of monks was put in charge of moving a giant clay Buddha. In the midst of the move one of the monks noticed a crack in the Buddha. Concerned about damaging the idol, the monks decided to wait for a day before continuing with their task. When night came, one of the monks came to check on the giant statue. He shined his flashlight over the entire Buddha. When he reached the crack he saw something reflected back at him. The monk, his curiosity aroused, got a hammer and a chisel and began chipping away at the clay Buddha. As he knocked off piece after piece of clay, the Buddha got brighter and brighter. After hours of work, the monk looked up in amazement to see standing before him a huge solid-gold Buddha.Many historians believe the Buddha had been covered with clay by Thai monks several hundred years earlier before an attack by the Burmese army. They covered the Buddha to keep it from being stolen. In the attack all the monks were killed, so it wasn&#x27;t until 1957, when the monks were moving the giant statue, that the great treasure was discovered. Like the Buddha, our outer shell protects us from the word: our real treasure is hidden within. We human beings unconsciously hide our inner gold under a layer of clay. All we need to do to uncover our gold is to have the courage to chip away at our outer shell, piece by piece.Could you be sitting on your own gold mine? Did you know the average American can retire a millionaire on his or her current income? Then, why don&#x27;t they? It&#x27;s simple. They haven&#x27;t been taught that they could. They are taught to use debt to get what they want now instead of having their money work for them. They pay too much in taxes. They are wasting money every month and don&#x27;t even realize it. In short, they are financially unhealthy.

In 1957, a group of monks in Thailand discovered a fascinating secret while relocating a giant clay Buddha. As they carefully examined the idol, one monk noticed a crack in the Buddha and wisely decided to wait a day before proceeding. During the night, one of the monks, intrigued by the crack, used his flashlight to inspect the area. To his surprise, he found something reflected back at him, prompting him to chip away at the clay. As the clay was removed, the Buddha's luminosity increased, revealing a magnificent solid-gold statue. Many historians believe that the Buddha had been covered with clay to protect it from the Burmese army's attack, which resulted in the monks' deaths. This story serves as a powerful metaphor for our own lives. Just as the Buddha's true value was hidden beneath a layer of clay, we too often conceal our inner worth beneath a disguise of insecurity, fear, or external influences.

Similarly, many individuals are unaware of the financial treasures hidden within their current income. Like the Buddha, their true potential remains buried beneath a layer of financial misconceptions, debt, and poor financial habits. It's time to unearth the gold within our means. By recognizing the importance of financial education, we can break free from"

I understand what you're saying, Eirikur. You've used neuro-conditioning to help children cope with stressful situations. The idea is to evoke a desired mental state, then associate it with a specific stimulus. In your example, you'd use a gentle shoulder pinch to recreate the state.

When faced with an uncomfortable situation, the children could recall the earlier state by triggering the pinch. While it's not a perfect solution, it has an undeniable effect. This concept might explain why some individuals, like Bob Dylan, rely on specific superstitions or rituals to perform better. The cue provides a link to a more relaxed mental state, which ultimately enhances their performance."

If a user has a whitelist_from entry in their.spamassassin/user_prefs file, it will indeed tell SpamAssassin to take no action against any mail coming from the specified domain. However, this doesn't necessarily mean the mail will be completely ignored.

When a mail message is processed by SpamAssassin, the whitelist_from entry is checked against the sender's email address. If a match is found, the message is not flagged as spam, but it is not necessarily marked as ""not spam"" either. Instead, SpamAssassin will still perform its usual checks against the message's contents and other factors, such as the sender's IP address and DNS records.

To make mail from yahoogroups.com completely ignored by SpamAssassin, the user needs to add a separate line in their user_prefs file, such as:

This will instruct SpamAssassin to stop processing the message as soon as it sees the X-Loop header, which is commonly used by mailing list services.

The survey found that internet-based trading now accounts for 38% of trading in the US, up from 28.5% in February and 25% in April 2000. However, this growth in online trading does not necessarily translate to increased market share, as most online trades are being completed through either OR EnronOnline, each of which has more than a third of the electronic market.

While internet-based trading has gained traction, traditional brokers still lead in processing most power trades due to their ability to offer options and other derivatives, as well as their dominance in the short-term physical markets. Additionally, some trading houses remain hesitant to adopt online technology.

The survey, which polled 40 power traders, highlights the evolving landscape of the power industry, with online trading expected to continue its growth trajectory. However, traditional brokers will likely remain a significant force in the market for the foreseeable future."

Hi there,

I wanted to reach out to you about something unusual that just occurred in the city where I'm based. My doctor recently expressed an idea that caught me off guard. I'm still trying to wrap my head around it, but it seems like it could be a symbol of something greater.

I'm not sure if it's related, but I've noticed that time seems to roll by really fast lately. I've been feeling a bit restless, and my friend and I have been discussing the idea of going on a trip to help clear our minds. We've been considering a destination where we can relax and enjoy the plain beauty of nature.

I've been thinking about writing a letter to a friend who is away on a ship. It's been a while since we've communicated, and I want to catch up on how they're doing. I've been feeling a bit stuck lately, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to write the letter today. If I do, I'll make sure to fill it with stories about my daily life and the desert landscapes I've been exploring.

I've also been thinking about how the sun seems to be acting strangely lately. It's as if nothing is happening, and the days feel like they're stretching"

Our recent discussion has led to several key decisions, which I'll outline below. 

The first important conclusion is that our primary goal is to develop a shared understanding among developers of the current state of affairs in the ""interop landscape"". This requires a comprehensive, accurate, and up-to-date documentation of existing interoperability solutions. To facilitate this, we're proposing the development of a shared wiki, which would allow contributors to pool their knowledge and experiences. 

Another key aspect is the identification of specific, high-priority areas for interop development. Based on our current understanding, these areas include web services, device and system APIs, and file formats. We're eager to hear from developers who have experience in these areas and would be willing to help shape the direction of our initiative. 

Additionally, we're planning to set up regular collaboration meetings to facilitate knowledge sharing and progress updates. These meetings would provide an opportunity for developers to get involved and contribute to the development of interop solutions. 

Overall, our aim is to create a dynamic, community-driven platform for developers to come together, share ideas, and collaborate on developing innovative interop solutions. If you're interested in participating or learning more, please don"

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out to you regarding our previous discussion about the possibility of collaborating on a project. After re-evaluating the scope and timeline, I've come to realize that it's essential for our team to focus on refining the concept before proceeding with implementation. In order to ensure the success of the project, I propose that we dedicate more time to researching and discussing the details.

Regarding the goodbye brigade, I want to emphasize that our goal is not to abandon the project entirely, but rather to reassess our approach and identify areas where we can improve. I believe that with a bit of creative thinking, we can overcome the current challenges and produce an exceptional outcome.

On a separate note, I'd like to invite you to join a meet-and-greet session with the development team, where we can share ideas and brainstorm potential solutions. This will be a great opportunity for us to connect and discuss our goals and aspirations.

Please let me know if this aligns with your schedule, and we can coordinate a date and time that suits you.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and ideas.

Congratulations on setting up maildrop with virtual users! Integrating Razor with maildrop is a great way to test its filtering capabilities. Although I couldn't find similar documentation for maildrop, you can use the following recipe as a starting point.

I used to run Vipul's Razor check # log `/usr/bin/razor-check` log ""razor-check = $RETURNCODE"" if ($RETURNCODE == 0) {   xfilter ""reformail -a 'X-Razor: SPAM'""   log ""SPAM caught by Vipul's Razor""   to ""$FOLDERS/.SPAM/"" } With Razor version 1, I had issues with false positives. I now use SpamAssassin with Razor2, which catches more spam that Razor alone. After whitelisting my newsletters, SpamAssassin with Razor2 does a great job.

You can remove the log statements once you're running. I use both Razor and SpamAssassin, as SpamAssassin catches spam that Razor doesn't.

Hope this helps!

Jeffrey"

"  Quoting Ronan Waide :    &gt; Sure, but soft links would do the same. To be honest, I&#x27;m trying to  &gt; think of a useful use of hard links right now, and I&#x27;m a little  &gt; stumped. There&#x27;s gotta be some benefit that I&#x27;m missing that&#x27;s  &gt; immediately obvious to everyone.No there doesn&#x27;t :-) . The Bell labs Unix people implemented hard links, whereas Bill Joy and co. at Berkeley implemented soft links, five years later, mainly to get around not being able to do cross-device hard linking, as I understand it. Soft links are fairly classic Berkeley hackery (cf. gethostbyname, h_errno, and the resultant problems implementing mt-safe interfaces); they do what they were intended for, but break fairly easily, in this case when the target file was deleted. For a better design for similar ideas, see the MacOS.--  I&#x27;m not a pheasant plucker / I&#x27;m a pheasant plucker&#x27;s son. I&#x27;m just a&#x27;plucking pheasants / &#x27;Til the pheasant plucker comes.--  Irish Linux Users&#x27; Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

Dear all,

Ronan Waide asked whether there's a practical use for hard links, considering soft links could achieve the same goal. He's genuinely seeking insight into the benefits that others may see. I'd like to share some historical context.

Hard links were implemented by the Bell Labs Unix team, whereas soft links were introduced by Berkeley's Bill Joy and colleagues, about five years later. Soft links were designed to overcome cross-device hard linking limitations. Although they fulfilled their purpose, they can be fragile and break easily, as seen in cases where the target file is deleted.

In contrast, hard links were designed to provide a more robust solution. However, it's worth noting that the MacOS offers a better design for similar concepts.

I'd love to hear any insights or practical examples of hard links' benefits that others may be aware of.

Incredible, but true.  Web forms can &gt; also accept /multiple/ or even /free-form/ telephone numbers and can &gt; even be partitioned into manageable steps. All this can also be done &gt; without selling exclusive rights to your wallet to the World&#x27;s &gt; Second-Richest Corporation (assuming Cisco is still #1) and vendor &gt; locking your business into their &quot;small transaction fee&quot; tithe. Ah, but you&#x27;ve just gotten to the crux of the situation.  There&#x27;s good design and bad design.  There&#x27;s good testing and bad testing.  The problem is, anyone can design a good Web form, but nobody does.  I think &quot;best practices&quot; hasn&#x27;t caught up on main street Web enablement yet.  There&#x27;s some really great packages on how to do this stuff and in fact the usability people knew that Web forms needed to be fixed 5 years ago, so that&#x27;s why we got XForms and  XHTML.  You can shoot yourself in the foot and people usually do.  What the problem is, they don&#x27;t even recognize that they&#x27;re gimpy--ever.  They just keeping trundling along making a mess of everything assured in their job security that they can build Web forms without even caring if they can be used or not beyond their test machine.If you had a piece of software and a security warning came out 5 years ago on it, would you run that software? Wouldn&#x27;t you have patched or upgraded something so fundamentally broken 4 years and 11 months ago?  What I want to know is why would someone use Web forms best practices from 5 years ago?  I mean you can get a college degree in that time.  Imagine if the next version of Microsoft Windows or Red Hat Linux forced you to use a tiled window manager?  Sure, tiled windows were the best we had for a brief period of time, but they are completely useless except for some terminal based replacement applications. The bottom line is, if you can&#x27;t get across the bridge, then it&#x27;s broken regardless of whose fault it really is, and it&#x27;s the business that  needs to take responsibility as they are the ones that wanted to put the bridge there in the first place.  Greg ",0,"Dear All,
I'm surprised to learn that many website designers are unaware that webforms can accept ""U.S. of A"" as a country, or multiple/free-form telephone numbers, and even be partitioned into manageable steps. Unfortunately, many designers create bad webforms that are not user-friendly, and this is a result of poor design and testing. The concept of ""best practices"" is still evolving, and it's essential to recognize that a well-designed webform is not just about aesthetics, but also about usability and accessibility.

I'm amazed that, even with the existence of XForms and XHTML, many people still use outdated webform designs. It's essential to keep up with the latest developments and adjust our designs accordingly. If a piece of software had a security warning five years ago, wouldn't you have updated it by now?

I believe it's the business's responsibility to prioritize webform design and testing, as they are the ones responsible for creating user-friendly experiences. The bottom line is that, if a bridge (webform) is broken, it's the business's fault, regardless of whose fault it is.

Sincerely,
Gary Lawrence Murphy"

I'm reaching out to share an exciting development in the field of pain management. My husband has been struggling with chronic pain, and I've recently come across an innovative treatment option called Vicodin. I was impressed to learn that it has shown promise in providing significant relief.

I'd like to request your assistance in exploring this possibility further. Could you please provide me with more information on Vicodin, such as its benefits, potential side effects, and any relevant studies or reviews? Additionally, I'd appreciate any guidance on how to approach discussing this with my husband, as he's been resistant to trying new treatments.

I understand that sometimes change can be difficult, but I believe this breakthrough holds great potential for his comfort and quality of life. I'd be grateful for any insight or support you can offer.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

"This seems to be a good argument for the odd number prerelease, even number  stables.So instead of a 0.61pre2 pre3,  and a 0.61final,  you&#x27;d stick with 0.61  with different releases, and a 0.62.0.61-1, 0.61-2, 0.62.  Would that that?--On Monday, August 19, 2002 17:25:04 +0200 Matthias Saou   wrote:&gt; Take for instance xmame : I&#x27;ve been packaging 0.61 pre-releases as &gt; &quot;0.61-fr0.x&quot; since the entire source has only &quot;0.61&quot; tags everywhere, no &gt; preversion tags whatsoever.                                    -- \m/ --   &quot;...if I seem super human I have been misunderstood.&quot; (c) Dream Theater          mark@talios.com - ICQ: 1934853 JID: talios@myjabber.net _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list",0," 

It seems that the odd number prerelease, even number stable release numbering convention makes sense. Instead of having separate releases like 0.61pre2 and 0.61final, we could stick with 0.61 as the main version and have different release tags like 0.61-1, 0.61-2, 0.62. This would simplify the naming convention and avoid confusion. 

For example, as Matthias Saou has done with xmame, we can package 0.61 prereleases as ""0.61-fr0.x"" since the source code lacks pre-version tags. This approach would be more coherent and easier to understand.

After successfully implementing the ""catchup unseen messages before cur"" procedure, I'm excited to share the code with the Exmh community. This procedure, initially inspired by John R. LoVerso, uses Tcl to automatically mark unseen messages as read up to the current message. The code, which you can add to your.tk/exmh directory, has been tested and is ready for use.

To utilize this feature, you'll need to add the following lines to your.exmh/exmh-defaults file:

*Fops.more.m.uentrylist:        ketchup
*Fops.more.m.l_ketchup:         Catch-up all before current
*Fops.more.m.c_ketchup:         My_Mark2CurSeen

By doing so, you'll be able to catch up on unseen messages before the current message with a single click. I hope this contribution is helpful, and I'm always open to any feedback or improvements.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.

Best regards,
Ted Cabeen

I've attached the revised Sea Robin volumes for your review. As you know, the plant was down on June 15th and 16th, and back up on June 17th. This changed the processing volumes for the period, which I've reflected in the attached spreadsheets.

The files show the revised volumes for each day: EI 305, EI 330, EI 333, and others. The attached spreadsheets contain the updated numbers, which reflect the decrease in processing volumes on June 15th and 16th, and the increase in volumes on June 17th, when the plant was back up.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. I forwarded these revised volumes to you on Friday, June 16th.

The textbook ""An Introduction to Japanese Linguistics"" by Tsujimura (1996) is the first comprehensive book on the structure of Japanese written in the framework of generative linguistics. This book serves as both an introduction to Japanese linguistics for those without prior knowledge and a reference for linguists. It covers phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, language change, dialect variation, and gender differences, introducing linguistic notions and terminology and analyzing theoretical perspectives.

The book focuses on phonology and syntax, employing the formal approach of generative grammar. Additionally, ""A Comprehensive Spanish Grammar"" by De Bruyne and Pountain (1995) offers a detailed exploration of the Spanish language, covering topics from pronunciation to specific challenges, such as verbs and word order. This book includes sections on regional diversity and Latin American Spanish.

Lastly, ""Drills in Arabic Writing & Pronunciation as a Foreign/Second Language"" by Dr. Jassem et al.

Dear Valued Shippers,

Kern River Pipeline is announcing an open season to gauge interest in year-round firm transportation (FT) services to Nevada and California, as well as interest in capacity relinquishment by existing firm shippers. Our pipeline is positioned to offer significantly reduced FT rates, thanks to recent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approval of our Extended Term Rate Program (ET Program). Under the ET Program, customers could benefit from a rate reduction of approximately $0.22 per decatherm (DTH) over a 15-year contract. Additionally, our system expansion plans can reduce overall rolled-in rates for all shippers.

The proposed mainline expansion of up to 500 million cubic feet per day (MMCF/D) is targeted for in-service by May 1, 2002. If goals are met using relinquished capacity and no new facilities are required, new service could begin as early as October 1, 2001. For more information, please contact Laurie Brown at (801) 584-6410 or Greg Snow at (801) 7270.

As we discussed with Oscar Wyatt and Tom Bachtell, we are open to considering any proposal that could help salvage some value from our investment.

As you are aware, we hold convertible preferred and a small amount of common stock in Crown Energy, which we acquired in 1997 for $5.5 million. If fully converted, our ownership would be approximately 25%. Unfortunately, the company is facing a significant net deficit of $21 million and has a ""going concern"" paragraph in its audit opinion. We have written down our carrying value to nil.

Regarding the ongoing arbitration proceeding with McNic Energy and McNic Pipeline, Crown Energy is seeking an award that could restore some value to our investment. The arbitration hearing is scheduled to take place from July 23 to August 10. We will seek further information from Tom Bachtell on his plans and recommend an appropriate position for Enron in this matter.

We look forward to your feedback and propose discussing this matter further."
" JH&gt; They are legally required to do that.  I got a similar check because an JH&gt; insurance company didn&#x27;t pay a claim quickly enough.  It might have been JH&gt; $.02.JH&gt; Although they spent lots more than $.33 to mail you the check, the JH&gt; alternative seems to be to keep the money.  Do you really want companies JH&gt; to have a financial incentive to over-bill you &#x27;just a bit&#x27; so they JH&gt; could keep it?  For a company with millions of customers, $.33/customer JH&gt; starts adding up. Christ, you sound worse than me.What I -said- in my post, John, was that instead of having to dole out stupid refunds, I&#x27;d rather they save the costs incurred, knock off one of those bullshit surcharges that they inevitably charge for promoting services like these, and move on.  SOmething tells me, it&#x27;d balance out.  Problem is, they&#x27;re silly, they don&#x27;t want to do this, and rather than the legislation coming up with an affective means of controlling the situation (overcharging) they impose silly requirements like this. &gt;&gt; From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of &gt;&gt; bitbitch@magnesium.net&gt;&gt; So I get a check from Pac Bell today (SBC as they&#x27;re called now). &gt;&gt; Turns out, they went to the trouble of printing out, signing, sealing &gt;&gt; and stamping a check just to refund me for a whole $0.33. &gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; They easily spent more than this just getting the materials together. &gt;&gt; Why the hell do companies bother to do this crap?  I mean, isn&#x27;t there &gt;&gt; a bottom line in terms of cost effectiveness?  I don&#x27;t think I missed &gt;&gt; the .33, but I sure as hell would have appreciated lower rates in lieu &gt;&gt; of being returned pennies. &gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m truly stuck on this though.  I don&#x27;t know whether to frame the &gt;&gt; check, burn it, or cash it in.  Maybe I should find a way to return to &gt;&gt; sender, so they have to spend -more- money on giving me my .33 dues. &gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; Does .33 even buy anything anymore?  Funny bit of it, is I couldn&#x27;t &gt;&gt; even make a phone call these days. &gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; *boggled* &gt;&gt; BB. &gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; -- &gt;&gt; Best regards, &gt;&gt;  bitbitch                          mailto:bitbitch@magnesium.net--  Best regards,  bitbitch                            mailto:bitbitch@magnesium.net ",0,"

I understand your frustration and skepticism when it comes to companies' practices, particularly when it comes to handling small refunds. You received a check from Pac Bell (now SBC) for a mere $0.33, which is significantly less than the cost they incurred in preparing and mailing the check. You question whether this is a cost-effective approach and whether it's worth framing the check, burning it, or cashing it in.

I agree that there's a strong case for reconsidering this practice. Instead of issuing refunds, companies could save costs by skipping the refund process altogether and reducing their surcharges for promoting services. This would seem to be a more logical approach, especially considering the millions of customers these companies serve. The issue at hand is not just about the $0.33, but about the underlying principle of over-billing and the subsequent costs incurred.

Your skepticism is well-founded, and it's crucial to keep in mind that companies are driven by profit motives. In this case, Pac Bell's actions seem more focused on demonstrating compliance with legal requirements rather than providing a reasonable service to customers.

I share your concerns about the lack of effective means to control overcharging and the resulting inefficiencies. It's essential to continue questioning and challenging these practices to ensure"

I agree with Tom that this kind of thinking is misguided. It's important to recognize that both heterosexual and homosexual individuals can be promiscuous, and that promiscuity is not unique to any one sexual orientation. Additionally, it's crucial to note that the issue of virus load is unrelated to the fact that some people are more promiscuous than others.

What I would like to highlight is that there is a specific subpopulation outside of the sex industry that has historically been extremely promiscuous, with an incidence rate that is two orders of magnitude higher than the average. This subpopulation has been previously overlooked in discussions about promiscuity and its implications.

I would encourage everyone to think critically about these issues and consider the complexities involved. Let's switch on our brains and examine the facts objectively, rather than making generalizations based on incomplete information.

"deacero , sa louise - some news and views for yourself on this credit . hedging this name for any duration past 5 years is all but impossible at present . insurance companies will write protection , with 10 % first loss being taken by ene ; but proof of loss must exist and all covents must be adhered to otherwise payout can be made void . believe the offering you have from zurich should be used to cover first 35 mil of 65 mil exposure at the front end . this is the cheapest alternative but does come with certain hindrances ; ie timeliness of payments and proof of loss . an additional constraint here is the bb or better private rating ene must get for deacero . what enroncredit can offer is to hedge the excess exposure above the insurance coverage . we would cover failure to pay and bankruptcy of said name . we would offer protection in either a 2 or 3 year rolling tranche format . protection can either be bought for the duration ( 15 yrs npv ) at 3 . 5 % , cash settlement ( louise you get paid out 100 - recovery ( of financial assets ) = payout ) . or on a rolling basis at 30 bpts over where enroncreit hedges itself in the market ( expect to get 2 yr protection off at 2 % per annum at present ) . we have the ability to structure this tranche on an accreting or amortising basis to either suit the p 95 or actual exposures ( payment can be made digital ; cost would be stated cost / ( 1 - . 35 % ( expected recovery ) ) . louise if you want to call me today to discuss i will be in till 18 : 00 london time . bill , we would hedge out the credit exposure on a ltol basis and run the duration risk , require permission from yourself to run / manage this risk . mkf",0,"

I wanted to share some key points regarding Deacero's credit situation. At present, hedging this name for any duration beyond 5 years is extremely challenging. Insurance companies are willing to provide protection, but they'll take a 10% first loss, and proof of loss must be proven for the payout to be valid.

Regarding Zurich's offering, I recommend using it to cover the first $35 million of the $65 million exposure at the front end. This is the cheapest alternative, but it comes with certain constraints, such as timely payments and proof of loss. Additionally, Deacero needs to obtain a BB or better private rating from ENE.

EnronCredit can offer protection for the excess exposure above the insurance coverage. We can provide failure-to-pay and bankruptcy coverage for Deacero. Our offer includes a 2- or 3-year rolling tranche format, with the option to buy protection for the entire duration (15 years NPV) at 3.5% or for a cash settlement (with a payout equal to 100% minus recovery).

We can structure the tranche on an accreting or amortizing basis to suit either the predicted 95% exposure or the actual exposure. We can also make payments digital,"

"finally i got it today &#x27; s message . today , we shall be disucssing the advantages of sleeping early . there are numerous benefits which can be enjoyed by you . i for one do not like sleeping late coz the i get tired easily . the next day is also suffering . so please sleep early . that &#x27; s it for now . jessica .",1,"I am thrilled to have finally received the message today. As we discuss the benefits of sleeping early, I would like to emphasize the numerous advantages that can be reaped. As someone who does not enjoy sleeping late, I can attest to the fact that it leaves me feeling tired and sluggish the next day. In contrast, going to bed early has been a game-changer for me. It not only allows me to wake up feeling refreshed, but it also helps me to tackle the day with more energy and vitality. I truly believe that this simple habit can have a significant impact on one's overall well-being.

I would encourage everyone to make it a priority to sleep early. It is a simple yet effective way to improve the quality of your life. I look forward to discussing this topic further and exploring ways in which we can incorporate this habit into our daily routines.

",0,"As David Pogue highlights in his recent discussion on the topic of Apple's past, present, and future, the Mac market is indeed experiencing growth. Although it may still constitute a relatively small share of a massive and expanding market, it's essential to recognize that Apple's demise has been greatly exaggerated. 

The reality is that Apple is not on the brink of extinction and will not be anytime soon. However, the company will never be the dominant force it once was. 

It's vital to keep this perspective in mind when assessing Apple's current status and future prospects."

I wanted to share my recent experience with you. As I was asking a question to a neighbor I had never met before, he quickly pigeonholed me and asked if I was an environmentalist. I couldn't help but feel a bit frustrated, especially considering my current job status. I will admit that the correlation might not be a coincidence, but I'm choosing to ignore it and move forward with the understanding that it's possible for individuals to grow and change.

"Rohit forwards from the NYT: &gt; Bigger Bar Code Inches Up on Retailers &gt; August 12, 2002 &gt; By KATE MURPHY I can&#x27;t imagine why they&#x27;re inching forward through  13- and then 14- digit extensions; seems they should just leap ahead to something with real headroom, say 40-digit numbers (128 bits or more). How hard can it be to widen the glyph area and  narrow the bars? The sensors have got to be tens or even hundreds of times more accurate/robust  than when barcodes first took off.One segment of the article along these lines:&gt; But moving to 13 digits may not be enough. The Universal &gt; Code Council and EAN International, which formed an &gt; alliance in 1996, strongly advise manufacturers and &gt; retailers to go a step further and prepare their systems to &gt; accommodate a 14-digit code. That is the length of a newly &gt; patented bar code that takes up less space. Its reduced &gt; size means that it can be affixed to small items like loose &gt; produce, and the extra digits let a retailer keep track of &gt; additional data like batch and lot numbers. A newly *patented* bar code, that merely fits 14 digits into less space? I sure hope there&#x27;s more to this &quot;invention&quot; than &quot;more lines, and narrower&quot;. They might as well go 2-D to fit in lots of extra bits, which could also ease the transition to the capacity  radio-transponder tags may offer.A bunch of info on different barcode standards, including 2-D variants, with examples is at:http://www.makebarcode.com/specs/speclist.htmlSomething very much like a 2-D barcode is Xerox &quot;Dataglyphs&quot;:http://www.parc.com/solutions/dataglyphs/- Gordon ____________________    Gordon Mohr  Bitzi CTO . . . describe and discover files of every kind.  _ http://bitzi.com _ . . . Bitzi knows bits -- because you teach it!http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork ",0,"
As the retail industry continues to evolve, it's crucial to ensure our barcodes keep pace with the growing demand for accuracy and efficiency. The recent development of 13- and 14-digit extensions is an attempt to bridge this gap, but I believe we're overlooking the bigger picture. Instead of incrementally increasing the number of digits, we should be designing barcodes that can accommodate larger data sets.

The Universal Code Council and EAN International advocate for moving to 14-digit codes, citing the need for additional space to store data like batch and lot numbers. However, I'm skeptical of the value this patented innovation brings. A more effective solution would be to transition to two-dimensional barcodes, which could not only increase data storage capacity but also ease the transition to radio-transponder tags.

For a comprehensive overview of different barcode standards, including two-dimensional variants, I recommend visiting [www.makebarcode.com/specs/speclist.html](http://www.makebarcode.com/specs/speclist.html). The Xerox Dataglyph is an excellent example of a two-dimensional barcode that could revolutionize the way we store and retrieve data.

I hope this email sparks a discussion about the future of barcodes and our role in shaping it. As we continue to navigate this"

"http://www.therockalltimes.co.uk/2002/04/08/new-tags.htmlW3C approves HTML 4 &#x27;emotitags&#x27; - Now you&#x27;ll be able to say it with feeling by Lester HainesThe World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has approved a number of new html &#x27;emotitags&#x27; which will revolutionise the web surfing experience.The tags have no physical effect, but rather elicit a strong emotional response from the reader. Top of the list is  (War on TerrorT). The tag, when judiciously applied, will immediately provoke violent anger against ragheads, thus:Charity agencies report that Iraqi leader Sadaam Hussein has adopted the African dictatorial habit of eating his political opponents.Of particular interest to British code-monkeys is the new  (I&#x27;m hurting too). This is designed for use when reporting on the life of Elizabeth the Queen Mother and other recently dead famous people:She touched our lives in so many ways with her common touch and her instinctive understanding of ordinary people. She will be sadly missed.The instantaneous effect is to reduce the reader to teary-eyed and self-indulgent wallowing in which he or she becomes unaccountably upset about the death of a complete stranger.Political reporting also looks to benefit from the new  tag. Any government ministerial pronouncement is thus rendered immediately transparent:Tony Blair was quick to defend transport secretary Byers, calling him &quot;the most honest man it has been my privilege to know&quot;.And, in a much-needed boost to satire sites, W3C has formally ratified the controversial . This guarantees any text contained within it complete immunity from prosecution:Naomi Campbell, we can confirm, is a talentless, drug-addicted perjurer who believes that good looks alone can justify her appalling and obnoxious behaviour.The new tags have been warmly received by the programming community. W3C has, however, warned that they are to be used economically. It has further cautioned that they should never be used together, since the effect on the reader could be catastrophic:In response to reports that the Queen Mother had fallen victim to Sadaam Hussein&#x27;s Axis of EvilT chemical weapons programme, Stephen Byers noted: &quot;She was everybody&#x27;s favourite grandmother who touched the lives of billions. The only consolation we can gain from this tragedy is that all of the UK&#x27;s trains will be running on time by next Monday. And you can quote me on that.&quot;http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork ",0,"
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has approved several new HTML ""emotitags"" that are designed to elicit strong emotional responses from readers. These tags have no physical effect, but rather aim to provoke feelings of anger, sadness, or self-indulgence.

One of the newly approved tags is the ""War on Terror"" symbol, which is intended to be used when reporting on sensitive topics, such as the Iraq War. When used, this tag is expected to induce violent anger towards the subject of the reporting, as seen in the example: ""Iraqi leader Sadaam Hussein has adopted the African dictatorial habit of eating his political opponents.""

The ""I'm hurting too"" tag is designed for use when reporting on the death of famous people, such as the Queen Mother. When used, this tag is expected to elicit feelings of sadness and self-indulgence, as seen in the example: ""She touched our lives in so many ways with her common touch and her instinctive understanding of ordinary people. She will be sadly missed.""

The ""transparent"" tag is intended for use in political reporting, allowing readers to quickly identify when a government minister is making a statement. The example provided is: ""Tony Blair was quick to"

Additionally, I'd like to explore the cases of [e] and [kai] in Hokkien and Teochew, which exhibit accidental homophony with [de] and [ge] in Mandarin.

Yeah, you can pack in lots of things &gt; into the header to try and get some negative points, but do they all make &gt; sense in combination.  Can you have a Pine message id in the same header &gt; with an Outlook Express one or a Mutt User-Agent?Yes, this is a big bonus of meta rules (new in 2.40); we can now e.g. check for an Outlook-style forwarded message, and not give it negative points unless it contains other signs of being from Outlook.&gt; I think the headers should be paid special attention to.  The message &gt; content of something from the NY Times or Lockergnome might look spammy, but &gt; usually they don&#x27;t forge or fake anything in the header.  Tone down the &gt; negative scores and ding them extra for any obvious forgeries.When we get more (good) &quot;nice&quot; tests, the GA will assign lower scores to them.

Let's examine the headers of incoming emails more closely. While it's tempting to pack headers with multiple details to gain negative points, we should ensure that these combinations make sense together.

For instance, can we have a Pine message ID alongside an Outlook Express User-Agent in the same header? With meta rules, which were introduced in version 2.40, we can now check for Outlook-style forwarded messages and adjust our scoring system accordingly.

I believe the headers should receive special attention. Although the content of a message from a reputable source like the NY Times or Lockergnome might appear spammy, the headers typically don't contain forged or faked information. Let's tone down the negative scores and award extra points for obvious forgeries.

When we gather more reliable ""nice"" tests, the Global Accuracy (GA) system will assign lower scores to them. Currently, there are few good ""nice"" tests in the rulebase, and many positive tests that newsletters trigger, posing a challenge for the GA to solve.

Considering the interest in an Irish distro, I'd like to explore the idea further. In fact, I've been giving it some thought and would be enthusiastic about creating a unique Irish distro. However, it's crucial to note that such a project would require a minimum of €300,000 in funding. Due to this significant financial hurdle, I haven't initiated the project myself.

I'd be happy to discuss this idea with others in the Irish Linux Users' Group and explore the possibility of securing the necessary funding. If there's general interest in the project, I'd be more than willing to take the lead and work with the community to make it a reality.

I am following up on our discussions regarding clustering for gas and power. I would greatly appreciate it if you could provide us with the list of Enron's curves by geographical region, separately for gas and power. This list will be crucial in implementing the clustering process for power curves.

As we discussed last week, the clustering process involves three key steps: deciding on geographical regions and curve assignment, selecting core curves for each region, and conducting regression analysis for each curve versus its corresponding core curve. We will work closely with Risk Control to finalize these steps.

Winston, could you please let us know if it is possible to run VAR for the clustering results obtained using SAS? Additionally, could you update us on the status of the refresh stage and if we should wait before proceeding?

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Dear linguistics enthusiasts,

I'm thrilled to share with you a collection of significant dates in the month of May that have shaped our understanding of language. From ancient times to modern discoveries, these dates are a testament to the fascinating evolution of linguistics.

On May 2, 1919, Baudouin de Courtenay conceded defeat in his bid for the presidency of Poland. Meanwhile, on May 3, 1955, Mouton & Co. discovered how American libraries order books and inadvertently started a series of books on linguistics instead of limericks.

May 5, 1403, marks the beginning of the Great English Vowel Shift, while Giles of Tottingham, a 14th-century resident, mistook a pub sign, asking for ale, only to be confused by the barmaid's response.

As we previously discussed, you can play a crucial role in ensuring a smoother transition on July 1st, whether you are implementing financials and HR or HR only.

One important aspect of the SAP integration is timekeeping. Although it may seem mundane at first glance, it is a vital component of the system. Time entry and coding populate not just payroll, but also projects and cost centers in real-time. This flexibility allows us to charge employee and contractor time to the areas they actually work in, which is customizable by business unit, company, or cost center.

To make this work as intended on July 1st, each organizational unit (cost center) needs to clarify the following questions:

1. Will contractors be required to enter time in SAP?
2. Will we use positive timekeeping (specifying cost centers or projects worked on) or ""exceptions"" only?
3. Is an approval process desired, and if so, what is it?
4. Will people use the self-service capability or rely on a timekeeper?
5. What projects and cost center codes should be used?

I've downloaded and installed GCC3 and LIBGCC3, but I'm still encountering the same error message when attempting to rebuild the RPM or recompile. I've performed these actions as the root user and also downloaded the files as root.

Could you offer any additional guidance on what might be causing the issue? I've never installed source RPMs using apt, but it's possible that the file not found error is due to the source RPM being installed. To investigate this, I'd like to check if the source RPM is present in the /usr/src/redhat/SPECS directory. If I find the mplayer.spec file, I can try running ""rpm -bb mplayer.spec"" to build a binary in /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/Matthias.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I'd like to reconnect with you and explore new ideas since our last meeting. I've been reflecting on our conversation, and I've come to realize that true innovation comes from embracing the uncertainty and complexity of the world. You mentioned the importance of being brutally honest, and I agree that authenticity is key to building meaningful relationships. However, I also believe that honesty can be a double-edged sword, as it can lead to hurtful truths and conflicts.

I've been pondering the concept of ""characters"" and how they remain unchanged despite our ever-evolving opinions. I've come to understand that it's our core values and principles that define us, not our temporary beliefs or opinions. This realization has led me to prioritize cultivating a sense of compassion, empathy, and kindness in my interactions.

I'm grateful for the reminder that every company's greatest asset is its customers, and I strive to provide exceptional service to those I interact with. I'm also reminded that true passion and dedication require a commitment to excellence, not just superficial appearances.

Lastly, I've come to realize that faith is not something we can simply adopt, but rather it's a state that we grow into through our experiences, relationships, and values. I believe that this growth"

"As yet another wave of people I know seem to have lost their jobs last week, here is the latest in what I&#x27;m seeing...* Even knowing a CTO/CEO/CFO may not even get your resume looked at, the feedback I&#x27;m getting is that hiring managers are only considering family and extended family for jobs - everyone has plenty of unemployed relatives.* Most job sites are now almost empty - so the practice of posting &quot;resume bait&quot; jobs is coming to an end. The postings they do have are months old bait. This is now a completely pointless way to look for a job.* We&#x27;re almost flatlne in jobs created for several months, where population growth needs about 120k jobs a month to keep things steady.* Unemployment rates are only staying steady becasue people drop out of the workforce number after they cant find a job for a long time. The &quot;not in labor force&quot; is rising 400k a month. International numbers are no better - technology is replacing people, especially the people tha tmake the technoogy.* Grad school programs are stuffed full of people for every non-tech major. Colleges are having big headaches dealing with all the day-job refugees.* Spam for porn, ink, and stocks has dropped off, spam (the english ones I see subject lines for) now seems to be dominated by work-at-home scams and resume services. That&#x27;s got to be a BAD sign.* FoRK is now almost all spam, somebody fix the damn subscriber-only-posting setting already, dont make me show up at your house Rohit ;)- Adam L. &quot;Duncan&quot; Beberg   http://www.mithral.com/~beberg/   beberg@mithral.comhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",0,"As a job seeker, I've been observing a concerning trend lately. It seems that hiring managers are now prioritizing family and extended family members for job openings, making it increasingly difficult for others to get their resumes looked at. The job posting sites are now largely empty, with many positions being months old. This makes the practice of posting ""resume bait"" jobs almost pointless.

The unemployment rates are steady, but only because people are dropping out of the workforce after an extended period of joblessness. The number of people not in the labor force is rising by 400,000 a month. International numbers are not faring any better, as technology is increasingly replacing human workers.

Grad school programs are overflowing with students for non-tech majors, and colleges are struggling to accommodate the influx of ""day-job refugees."" The proliferation of work-at-home scams and resume services in spam emails is also a concerning sign.

I urge job seekers to be cautious and prepared in this challenging job market. It's essential to adapt to the changing landscape and be proactive in finding alternative opportunities."

Are you considering trying Ciallis for the first time? I wanted to highlight some of the benefits you can expect from this product. Unlike other ED treatments, Ciallis can provide a prolonged and reliable erection, lasting for 36 hours. This means you can take control of your sexual experiences and enjoy a longer period of intimacy.

One of the key advantages Ciallis offers over other ED treatments, such as Viagra, is its speed of action. You can expect to start feeling the effects within just 10 minutes of taking the medication. Additionally, Ciallis can be used in conjunction with alcohol, making it an attractive option for those who enjoy socializing with friends.

It's also worth noting that Ciallis can be shipped to any country, making it easily accessible. If you're interested in trying Ciallis, I encourage you to take the first step today. You can visit our website to learn more and place an order.

Hi there,

I've come across an incredible secret that can drastically increase your sexual attractiveness with women. Our pheromone concentrate, androstenone, is a natural, odorless, and undetectable substance that can stimulate a woman's raw animal sex drive, making her irresistibly attracted to you. This scientifically-backed pheromone has been featured on major media outlets and has been praised by men across the country.

The article I found on Wired News (http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,53928,00.html) highlights the dangers of this endeavor. It's worth noting that the last person to attempt this feat died due to equipment failure.

Further research reveals that the jumper will be breaking the sound barrier at 35,000 meters and likely reaching top speed above 30,000 meters. It's surprising that he's taking this risk, considering the risks involved.

I couldn't help but wonder if his attempt will qualify him for the Darwin Awards if he doesn't make it. The phrase ""French people..."" seems rather... interesting. Nevertheless, I hope Michel Fournier's attempt is successful and he avoids any, ahem, ""French"" mishaps.

I was mistaken about Hernando DeSoto's arrival in Florida. Since DeSoto was born around 1500 and Cortez arrived in 1519, it's unlikely that DeSoto was the one who landed in Southern Florida. If it wasn't DeSoto, who was it that encountered the mound-dwellers, only to find that they had vanished by the time Cortez arrived?

This mystery still intrigues me, and I'd love to learn more about the explorer who preceded Cortez in Florida. Perhaps you, Robert, or someone else in the fork mailing list can shed some light on this historical enigma.

Hi folks,
I'm writing to inform you that after upgrading the kernel on one of my home machines from 2.2.18pre21 to 2.4.19, I'm experiencing an issue with my network card. Specifically, I'm getting two interfaces, eth0 and eth1, instead of the usual eth0. Additionally, packets can't come in, although packets can be sent out.

I've noticed that the 3c509 module is loading, but it's being loaded with a different IRQ (5 and 10) compared to the previous kernel version (IRQ 10). I've tried disabling the 3c509 module and loading it manually, but it still loads with the incorrect IRQ.

Anyone have any suggestions on what might be causing this issue, which seems to be specific to kernel 2.4? I'm running a Debian 3.0 distro, and the hardware and BIOS seem to be fine, as it works correctly when booted to kernel 2.2.

Thanks,
~Al

Regarding the Tenaska IV issue, I'd like to revisit the discussion about Ena's ability to manage the plant's positions. As you know, we are unable to reach an agreement via phone. I'd appreciate it if you could recommend an alternative party who could assume the same terms under Ena's management. However, I must emphasize that the equity owners are already in talks with a buyer interested in the asset, so the arrangement would likely be short-term.

Regarding point (2), did your discussions with Legal lead to any conclusions regarding compensation for the project? Can you also clarify the amount of the claim the project has against Ena? I agree that the project should make direct payments to suppliers and Lone Star. I'm available to discuss further and would appreciate a call if possible.

Please let me know how we can proceed with the fuel management, considering Ena's financial situation and the uncertainty surrounding Enron's ownership in the plant.

"Brian O&#x27;Donoghue wrote a code fragment: &gt; For(a=0;a { &gt;  some_thing_goes_here(); &gt; &gt;  if(b=strlen(somestring)-4) &gt; do_something; &gt; &gt; };Unfortunately strlen is a relatively expensive operation. If you are using C++ this is not such a big issue as string.length() can be declared const. So long as you do not modify the string object, the compiler can do the caching for you.I do not think this is possible in C, though?You could write the same code fragment as: ============================ for(a=0,l=strlen(somestring);a&lt;l;a++) {     some_thing_goes_here();     if(b==l-4)         do_something(); } ============================Note my previous point: if some_thing_goes_here() or do_something() are very long functions, then there is no real need to optimise this code.Also, for string manipulation, a much better approach would be: ============================ char c; char* p; for(p=somestring,(c=*p)!=0;p++) {     some_thing_goes_here();     if(*(p+4)==0)         do_something(); } ============================This works because C used \0 terminated strings. It improves performance because you always have a pointer to the character instead of having to do array manipulation. Strictly speaking, the variable c is not required as most compilers are smart enough to store *p in a register.The problem is that this uses pointer arithmetic, which can make the code illegable if not managed carefully. Which is one of the reasons I prefer Java for most programming tasks. :)- Matthew __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?

List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie ",0,"I understand that you are discussing the optimization of a code fragment in C. Your initial code uses the `strlen` function, which can be expensive. I agree that in C++, `string.length()` can be declared `const` to optimize the operation, but this is not possible in C.

You have suggested alternative approaches, including using a loop with a variable length calculated using `strlen` and using pointer arithmetic to iterate over a null-terminated string. The latter approach is interesting, as it avoids the need for array manipulation and takes advantage of the fact that C strings are null-terminated.

However, you also mention that this approach uses pointer arithmetic, which can make the code less readable if not managed carefully. I understand your preference for using Java for most programming tasks, as it can simplify many programming tasks and provide better memory management.

Overall, the goal is to optimize the code while keeping it readable and maintainable. If the `strlen` function is indeed the bottleneck, then the alternative approaches you suggested could be considered."

Dear Dale, Stinson, and Vince,

I would like to take this opportunity to summarize the projects I have worked on over the past six months. During this period, I have been involved in various initiatives that have contributed to the commercial group's success. I would like to highlight a few projects that I believe are noteworthy.

Firstly, I have been instrumental in the development of inflation models, which have had a significant impact on the company's earnings. Specifically, my work on the inflation models has resulted in a gain of over £7 million for QL and large P&L swings for Eastern Contract Optionality. Additionally, I have been critical in the successful building of these curves, which has earned me recognition among various group heads.

To provide a comprehensive overview of my projects, I have compiled a list of the main initiatives I have worked on over the past five/six months. These include:

* Inflation curve modelling
* UK Power monthly vol curve generator and ideas for half-hourly vol curve
* Nordic Power monthly vol curve generator
* EnergyDesk.com models and support
* Real options: options to build/extend power stations (e.g., Wessex deal, Anti-freeze project)
* Continental Power non-generic options (using arbitrary trader"

As per our commitments this week, there is a meeting with CMS on Wednesday regarding the outsourcing opportunity. We have been shortlisted, and it's crucial to decide who should attend the interview with the potential client. Please let me know your availability, and we can discuss who would be the best representative.

Additionally, I wanted to inform you that I will be out of the office on Wednesday, March 28, as I will be in Austin interviewing candidates for the Enron scholarships. This will be our third year offering scholarships to top MBA students. It's been a great PR opportunity for Enron and has helped in our recruiting efforts. I will be available during breaks to check messages and return to Houston in the late afternoon.

On Friday, March 30, I will be in New York, participating in a Women in Business panel discussion at Columbia School of Business. I think it's an excellent opportunity to showcase Enron's presence in the industry.

Are you suggesting that the reliability of a programming language depends on the skill level of its developers rather than its intrinsic properties? Your example of two programmers with different coding styles and productivity levels highlights the importance of considering the human factor in software development. You're implying that choosing the right language for a project ultimately depends on the capabilities of the team involved, regardless of the language's reputation for reliability.

I agree that this is a crucial aspect to consider, as even the most robust language can produce faulty code if used by an inexperienced developer. This perspective underscores the need for continuous learning, experimentation, and improvement in the development process.

Your humorous tone and relatable example have effectively conveyed this point. By highlighting the role of human factors in software development, you've reminded us that the effectiveness of a language is not solely determined by its internal characteristics, but also by the expertise and experience of the people using it.

Well-written code is essential, regardless of the language. Your witty remark serves as a valuable reminder that developers should focus on writing clean, maintainable code, regardless of the language used.

Best bang for the buck: the Ford Mustang Cobra, capable of 390 horsepower, can be purchased for $35,000. On a recent outing, I came away with a huge smile, if only the car's design wasn't so unappealing. It's a shame, really, considering Ford's long history of producing...unfortunate-looking vehicles. On the other hand, one can acquire a Honda RSX Type S with 200 horsepower for a mere $23,000. I haven't had the chance to drive an RSX, but based on my experience with late-model Integras, I'm confident that the RSX would leave the Mustang in its dust whenever actual steering wheel movement is required.

Meanwhile, Joseph S. Barrera III wrote, on a completely unrelated topic, to inquire about the cargo area of a Mercedes-Benz G55. He's considering storing his new Honda del Sol in the G55's trunk and was wondering if it would fit. - Geege Schuman"

I still believe self-add whitelists are underappreciated. For a FoRK whitelist, it's likely that it would initially include all subscribers and expand from there. Addressing bouncing problem mail in a way that's comprehensible to humans can help them whitelist themselves for a resend, avoiding the issue of silent failures without opening the door to lazy, forged-""from"" spammers.

However, I see a significant problem with this system, which is the automated but essential emails like online tickets and bills. Besides lists, this is the reason I can't adopt such a system.

Thank you for your interest in Mouton de Gruyter's Linguistics volumes. We are pleased to announce the publication of our latest volumes, which feature a range of thought-provoking articles.

In Volume 36, Part 2, Julia Barron explores the concept of contraction, examining ""trace effects"" in a theory without movement. Kerstin Blume presents a contrastive analysis of interaction verbs with dative complements, while Janice L. Jake discusses the relationship between utterance modifiers and universals of grammatical borrowing.

In Volume 36, Part 3, Laurie Bauer asks whether there is a class of neoclassical compounds, and if so, whether it is productive.

I am writing to bring to your attention a pressing environmental issue. The UK Environment Agency has proposed an alarming decision that allows a significant increase in the emissions of a radioactive gas produced in reactors. According to reports, the Agency plans to permit a trebling of these emissions, which has sparked widespread criticism and dismay.

Critics have labelled this decision &quot;spineless&quot; and have expressed deep concern about the potential consequences for public health and the environment. It is imperative that we take immediate action to address this issue and ensure that our environment is protected for future generations.

I urge the Environment Agency to reconsider its proposal and adopt more stringent measures to minimize the emissions of this radioactive gas. It is the responsibility of all stakeholders, including government agencies, industries, and civil society, to work together in addressing this pressing issue.

I would appreciate any updates on this matter and look forward to hearing your thoughts on this issue.

It was fucking BRILLIANT. Do you know what &gt; exposure that got &gt; them? They sat perfectly so that the cameras could focus on the mildly &gt; exasperated Rumsfeld and their &quot;UN Inspections not war&quot; banner.What I am specifically referring to is protesters shouting down speakers or making so much noise that it interferes with the speaker. That&#x27;s wrong, immoral and unethical no matter what the political bent of the speakers and the protesters. Rowdy protests in their own venue (on a college campus or some of the commons areas of DC) is perfectly fine by me. Waving signs to get attention is fine.&gt; That picture &gt; will be dominating the news cycles in China, Iraq, Russia, Germany, and &gt; France, at least. For goodness sakes, you&#x27;re arguing about it on FoRK. In &gt; politics by sound-bite, those two rude hags kicked ass and took names. &gt; &gt; For the record, I don&#x27;t think they even got arrested, which is a shame.Well, Owen implied the protesters were arrested. Was he just jacking himself off at the expense of other people? Exactly why is it a shame that they were not arrested? Think about what you are saying and what you are telegraphing about your state of mind here. You WANT people to do bad things (ie, police arresting peaceful protesters) if it can help you further your cause? That attitude just sucks. You have no moral ground to stand on if that is what you believe.&gt; It is part of the game -- make an ass of yourself, get your point on &gt; the nightly &gt; news, spend a couple days in the clink for disorderly.Sure, just don&#x27;t whine about getting arrested if you make it a point to get in someone&#x27;s face.One other comment... Most of the people that are protesting against taking out the Iraqi dictator wouldn&#x27;t give a rats ass if a nuke went off in NYC. They simply wouldn&#x27;t care so why in the hell should the Americal public listen to them on matters of national security?So enlighten me, exactly why shouldn&#x27;t Hussein be taken out? And if your answr boils down to &quot;i don&#x27;t give a shit about what happens to the US&quot;, you can kiss my ass :-)Bill ",0,"I strongly believe that anyone who interrupts a speaker or creates a disturbance that interferes with their message is morally wrong. This behavior is not acceptable, regardless of the political views of the speaker or the protesters. It's essential to recognize that the goal of public discourse is to engage in respectful dialogue, not to disrupt or silence others.

In the context of the recent Rumsfeld event, I find it astonishing that some individuals would resort to such tactics. It's not only disrespectful but also damaging to the overall integrity of the conversation. Instead, we should strive for a more constructive exchange of ideas, even if we don't agree.

Furthermore, I find it troubling that some individuals might argue that it's acceptable to disrupt a speaker if it garners attention or achieves their political goal. This attitude is not only misguided but also sends a harmful message about the importance of respect and civility in our public discourse.

I believe that we should strive to promote a culture of constructive engagement, where opposing views are respected and engaged with in a respectful manner. This is essential for maintaining a healthy and vibrant democracy."

Below are the proposed improvements:

The document should use a consistent use of ""like"" instead of ""just like"", as the latter is an obsolete construct. Also, the document should avoid enclosing tag argument values in both single and double quotes, and opt for a standard format.

It's recommended to add the ""#"" symbol before hex RGB codes for color arguments, and ensure that the RGB code values are always six digits long. Additionally, it's a good practice to use consistent casing for ""onMouseOver"" and similar attributes throughout the document.

One customer, Geoffrey, has reported that his sperm volume increased by an unspecified amount, which he found impressive. Ken, another customer, expressed his concern that his semen might become too thick, but he is pleased with the results nonetheless.

Sharon's husband decided to try Spur-M, and she is thrilled with the outcome. She loves the experience of her husband's semen being released. Similarly, Jose has seen a significant improvement in his semen, describing it as a thick, forceful blob that hits his wife's body with great force.

Michael, another satisfied customer, shared his excitement about being able to shoot semen like a porn star, while Michael's wife and he have noticed improved fertility results after using Spur-M for two months.

As we delve into the intricacies of physics, a debate has emerged regarding its cultural dependence or independence. You've been engaged in a discussion with a physicist who believes that concepts in physics are not created, but rather discovered through observation of the world. He argues that, regardless of the cultural background, the laws of physics would remain unchanged. For instance, he suggests that if physics were developed by the Navaho or Highland Papuan people, the resulting understanding of the physical world would be identical to the Western paradigm.

However, I'd like to challenge this perspective by highlighting the role of language and cultural context in shaping our understanding of physical phenomena. My colleague believes that the absence of a concept in a language would not hinder the development of a corresponding physical understanding, as the physical forces would remain the same, waiting to be observed. I, on the other hand, argue that the lack of a concept would lead to a fundamentally different understanding of the physical world.

To strengthen my case, I'm seeking examples of languages that do not possess a concept equivalent to the physical force. It's essential to consider the possibility that the absence of a concept might influence the development of a particular type of physics. I believe that the cultural and linguistic background plays a significant role in shaping"

Dear all,

I'd like to share a thought-provoking article on the Slashdot website. The author discusses the concept of happiness, specifically comparing the emotional state of a believer to that of a skeptic. The article suggests that a believer can find happiness in their convictions, even in the face of uncertainty, whereas a skeptic may struggle to find contentment due to their critical nature.

The article also touches on the idea that credulity, or the tendency to believe without question, is a cheap and potentially dangerous quality. This resonates with me, as I believe that skepticism is a vital component of a healthy and informed outlook.

As the Irish Linux Users' Group, I think it's essential for us to cultivate a culture of critical thinking and skepticism. By doing so, we can foster a community that values evidence-based decision-making and open-minded discussion.

I encourage you all to read the article and share your thoughts on the topic. You can find the article on the Slashdot website, and I look forward to hearing your perspectives.

Best regards,

I'd like to express my concerns about the alleged news articles I've come across. The article on Pravda mentions Soviet nukes going missing in Ukraine, while an Associated Press report suggests a possible arms deal between Ukraine and Iraq. I'm not sure what to make of these reports, as the credibility of both sources is questionable. 

While I understand the importance of being informed, I believe it's essential to approach these claims with a healthy dose of skepticism. The ease with which these alleged transactions could be smuggled, especially in some parts of Europe, is indeed unsettling. I hope it's just my imagination playing tricks on me as well. 

On a separate note, I appreciate your words of encouragement and the wisdom you've shared about finding love when you least expect it. Your story about finding your Very Special Lady is truly inspiring. 

Best regards,
Rohit Khare"

"&gt; &gt; Is the use of &quot;trusted hardware&quot; really worth it ? &gt; &gt; Answering that requires fairly complete knowledge of the business &gt; model. But, in all probability: no, it isn&#x27;t usually worth it. So, it &gt; comes down to how difficult you want to make the cracker&#x27;s job. &gt; &gt; &gt; Look at the DVDs. &gt; &gt; IIRC, CSS was cracked by reverse-engineering a software player; and &gt; one where the developers forgot to encrypt the decryption key at that.This make me wonder about the relative protection of smart cards.  They have  an internal procession unit around 4MHz.  Can we consider them as trusted  hardware ?  The ability to ship smart cards periodicaly uppon cashing of a  monthly subscription fee would not raise too much the cost of &quot;renting&quot; the  system.  Smart card do their own self encryption.  Can they be used to  decrypt data needed by the system ?  The input of the system could me mangled  and the would keep a reference of how long it was in service.This sounds really feasible but I may be totaly wrong.  I may also be wrong  about the safety of a smart card.  What do you think ?--  Yannick Gingras Coder for OBB : Oceangoing Bared Bonanza http://OpenBeatBox.org ",0,"Dear Yannick,

When considering the use of ""trusted hardware"" in protecting data, it's essential to weigh the costs against the benefits. In many cases, the added security measures may not be worth the expense. A good example of this is the CSS encryption used in DVDs. The encryption key was eventually reverse-engineered by crackers, who simply re-created a software player that bypassed the encryption.

Similarly, smart cards, which contain their own processing unit and encryption capabilities, may not provide the level of security needed for certain applications. While they do perform self-encryption, it's unclear whether they can be used to decrypt data required by the system. If the input data is modified, a smart card could potentially store a record of the data's history.

While this approach may seem feasible, it's essential to consider the potential vulnerabilities in smart card technology. I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on this matter.

Turkic Languages: The First Comprehensive Reference Book in Almost Forty Years
The Turkic languages, edited by Lars Johanson and Eva Agnes Csato, is the first reference book in almost forty years to bring together detailed discussions of the historical development and specialized linguistic structures and features of the languages in the Turkic family. Written by an international team of experts, Turkic languages will be invaluable to students and researchers within linguistics, Turkology, and Near Eastern and Oriental studies.

The uralic languages, edited by Daniel Abondolo, provides a unique survey of individual Uralic languages and sub-groupings. This book gives an overview and then detailed analyses of the Uralic languages, describing their history and development as well as focusing on their linguistic structure. Each chapter is similarly structured, designed for comparative study, including phonology, morphology, syntax, lexicon, and sample text where available. Each chapter includes numerous tables to support and illustrate the text and bibliographies of major references in each language to aid further study.

These books are part of the Routledge Language Family Descriptions series, which provides comprehensive descriptions of the world's major language families. With over 500 and 648 pages, respectively, these volumes offer unparalleled insights into the Turk"

"workshop annoncement and call for papers - clitics workshop announcement and call for papers c l i t i c s 24th - 26th february 1999 konstanz university , germany we are pleased to announce our workshop on &#x27; clitics &#x27; during the 21st annual meeting of the german society of linguistics in konstanz ( germany ) . in linguistic research , clitics play an increasingly prominent role . the status of clitics is under discussion in phonology , morphology , and syntax , as well as in the respective interfaces . in these fields , the discussion on clitics gives rise to controversial analyses . one open question is whether we need in fact a separate linguistic category &#x27; clitic &#x27; , or whether these elements can be subsumed under different linguistic categories , such as affixes . - with respect to phonology , it is undetermined how clitics are incorporated into phonological structure . should we distinguish a clitic group in the prosodic hierarchy , are clitics part of prosodic words , or are they left outside prosodic structure ? how is their phonological deficiency best accounted for ? - concerning the morphology of clitics , especially regarding the occurrence of opaque clitics in clitic clusters , analyses within the framework of distributed morphology compete with those which propose an optimality theoretic solution . - also , the morphosyntactic status of clitics is unclear . is it possible to capture the order of clitics in clitic clusters in a more explanatory way than in terms of templates ? the complex conditions on clitic doubling give rise to the question whether clitics should be analysed as agreement markers or as arguments . - syntactic aspects of clitics play a major role in recent analyses in different theoretical frameworks . for instance , there is no agreement on the explanation of clitic climbing and it is an unsettled issue whether clitic placement should be accounted for in a syntactic , prosodic , prosodic-syntactic , or optimality-theoretic approach . the workshop intends to bring together phonologists , morphologists , and syntacticians and provides an ideal opportunity to share insights and to discuss the issues mentioned above . in addition to the invited speaker presentations , there are 9 slots for 30 - minute presentations , and 3 slots for 1 hour presentations ( including discussion ) . invited speakers : geert booij ( free university amsterdam ) jane grimshaw ( rutgers university ) juan uriagereka ( university of maryland ) please send a one-page abstract before 15th august 1998 to : birgit gerlach &amp; janet grijzenhout , seminar fuer allgemeine sprachwissenschaft , heinrich - heine - universitaet , universitaetsstr . 1 , 40225 duesseldorf , germany . we may be contacted by e-mail at gerlach @ phil-fak . uni-duesseldorf . de , or grijzenh @ phil-fak . uni-duesseldorf . de",0,"

We are pleased to announce the 24th-26th February 1999 Clitics Workshop at Konstanz University, Germany, in conjunction with the 21st annual meeting of the German Society of Linguistics. Clitics are increasingly prominent in linguistic research, and we invite papers that address the status of clitics in phonology, morphology, and syntax.

In phonology, the incorporation of clitics into prosodic structure remains unclear. Do we distinguish a clitic group in the prosodic hierarchy, or are they part of prosodic words? How do we account for their phonological deficiency?

In morphology, distributed morphology competes with optimality-theoretic solutions for opaque clitics in clitic clusters. What is the best way to capture the order of clitics in these clusters?

Syntactic aspects of clitics are also crucial. For instance, there is no agreement on explaining clitic climbing. Should we account for clitic placement in a syntactic, prosodic, prosodic-syntactic, or optimality-theoretic approach?

Our workshop aims to bring together experts in phonology, morphology, and syntax to share insights and discuss the issues mentioned above. We invite submissions for 30-minute presentations and 1-hour presentations with"
"Robin Lynn Frank  writes:&gt; I may be dense, but why would anyone want to utilize Habeus?  To me, &gt; it looks like a potential backdoor to anyone&#x27;s defenses against spam. &gt; &gt; If I were a spammer, I&#x27;d simply set up a server, send out my spam with &gt; the Habeus headers and continue till I was reasonably certain I&#x27;d been &gt; reported.  Then I&#x27;d simply reconfigure the server and reconnect to a &gt; different IP.  As long as no one can establish my connection to the &gt; web sites my spam is directing people to, I&#x27;m home free.Here is the bug I opened:  http://www.hughes-family.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=762RBLs have the same problem, but there is no negative RBL header rule with a -20 score that can be forged, so the problem is unique to Habeas.&gt; Since I can set up spamassassin to I don&#x27;t &quot;lose&quot; any email, what do I &gt; gain by making it easier for spam to get through??My primary issue is the magnitude of the negative score and that it was not determined empirically.  I am also concerned that it was added after the rules freeze, that such a major change was not discussed in advance, etc.There&#x27;s also no evidence that the rule will actually reduce FPs.  People who are smart enough to use the rule are probably capable of writing email that doesn&#x27;t look like spam (I&#x27;m not counting spam mailing lists which you need to be exempted from spam filtering).Dan ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by: Jabber - The world&#x27;s fastest growing  real-time communications platform!

I'd like to express my concern regarding the Habeus rule, specifically the negative score and its potential to compromise email security. In my opinion, allowing this rule to stand opens a backdoor to spammer's defenses, making it easier for them to evade detection.

From a practical standpoint, if I were a spammer, I would set up a server, send out spam emails with the Habeus headers, and then reconfigure the server and reconnect to a different IP once I've been reported. As long as no one can link my server to the websites my spam directs users to, I'd be in the clear.

I've reported this issue here: http://www.hughes-family.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=762. The problem is unique to Habeus, as other Real-time Blacklist (RBL) systems have a negative header rule with a -20 score that can't be forged.

I fail to see the benefit of making it easier for spam to get through, especially when using SpamAssassin doesn't result in lost emails. My primary concerns include the magnitude of the negative score, which wasn't determined empirically, and the fact that it was added after the rules freeze, without prior discussion.

I appreciate your update, especially your point 3, which aligns with our own discussions yesterday. To clarify, I'd like to address the responsibilities for the maintenance and administration of VAR. We need transparency around the process to ensure that mapping decisions, such as those made yesterday, are easily made, supported, and reviewed.

After last Friday's events, it became clear that our current approach to handling VAR is problematic, particularly at ""pressure points."" I'm assembling a scope for a ""general overhaul"" of the VAR process, including methods and administration, which I hope we can all support. Be assured of our cooperation.

In this context, I'd like to clarify the discussion we had during the VAR coordination meeting on mapping forward price curves into core locations. We agreed on the following:

1. Winston will investigate the IT side to determine the extent to which we can increase the number of forward price curves simulated as basic (core) curves and assess the impact on the time required to complete the VAR run.
2. We should model the curves associated with the biggest 10-20 positions in each commodity as core curves, monitoring the biggest risks separately to avoid aggregating them into less transparent aggregates.
3. We should systematically monitor the results of automated clustering (mapping"

In Dutch, the word ""u"" is used, while in German, it's ""sie."" This usage is likely linked to a sense of respect, similar to the capitalization of pronominal references to deity. However, in modern Netherlands Dutch, this practice is declining, and ""u"" is used in a more general sense, whereas in Belgian Dutch (Flemish), it seems to be retained more widely. Interestingly, in Belgium, people use ""u"" with each other, often without intending to be overly polite. In contrast, in England, the capitalized ""I"" is likely a typographical convention, rather than an expression of respect, as lower-case ""i"" can be quite small. Paul Werth"

I'm writing to propose a word that I think should be more widely used in our daily conversations. It's a word that, much like ""squick"" or ""schmegma,"" has the potential to become a part of our everyday language. I'm referring to a word that, in my opinion, deserves a special place in our vocabulary.

As you mentioned Lewis Carroll's contributions to our language, I'd like to draw your attention to some of the lesser-known words he introduced in his writings. Words like ""slithy,"" ""mimsy,"" ""gimble,"" and ""frumious"" have already become a part of our linguistic heritage. I believe that with a little creativity and experimentation, we can find more words that share the same charm and potential.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this idea and explore the possibilities of inventing a new word that could become a part of our everyday language. Let's keep the conversation going and see where it takes us!

List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie ",0,"Hi all,

I wanted to share an exciting new feature in the development snapshot of PuTTY: built-in proxy support. This allows users to connect to external hosts using SSH via a HTTP proxy. Squid and other good HTTP proxies typically only allow connections to port 443, so the SSH daemon needs to listen on this port. PuTTY's proxy support is still a bit flaky, but it's available.

I've experimented with SOCKS proxy support, but it's not stable yet. Another option is using netcat, which can establish raw connections and send keepalives to prevent session timeout.

Here's a sample function to use netcat for HTTP proxy tunneling:

```
http_proxy_tunnel() {
  mkfifo in.fifo
  (echo ""CONNECT $1:$2 HTTP/1.1""; echo ""HOST: $1:$2""; echo ""HTTP/1.1""; echo; cat in.fifo) | nc myproxy 3128 | (read; read; nc -lp < in.fifo)
}
```

This function assumes you have Bash, and you can use it with Cygwin or natively. Another option is using OpenSSH, which has excellent proxy configuration options.

If you fail to meet our expectation of delivering king-size products, she's not going to be happy. Specifically, if your product is not 2 meters and 6 centimeters in length, 2 meters and 6 centimeters in width, 2 meters and 6 centimeters in breadth, and 384 grams in weight, you're bound to disappoint her. It seems she's rather particular about the specifications of the products you deliver.

I want to emphasize that it's crucial to meet these exact specifications, so I won't waste my breath on anything less. If you're unwilling to take the initiative to ensure your product meets these requirements, then perhaps you're not the kind of person I'm looking for. Instead of relying on others to do the work for you, I expect you to take ownership of the process and ensure the product meets my expectations.

We are updating our process for reimbursing individually billed items such as cell phones, pagers, and other expenses. Due to the increased use of these items, our Accounts Payable department has seen a significant rise in the number of invoices and vendors. To maintain a timely payment cycle, we have reviewed our processes and would like to introduce a change.

While we encourage vendors to address their invoices to individual employees, we often receive invoices without the employee's name. This can lead to delays in processing the invoices, as we try to track down the employee responsible for the expense. To reduce the time spent on research and forwarding invoices, we request that employees with individually billed items pay for them personally and submit their expenses through employee expense reports.

This change will not only reduce the time spent on research and forwarding invoices but also decrease the number of checks generated by Treasury, the number of vendors in our database, and the turnaround time for payment of invoices. We are currently implementing a web-based expense reporting system, similar to what Enron International has used for the past year, which will make it even easier to file your expense report and receive quick reimbursement.

During the configuration process, the command ""/bin/sh admin/config.sub athalon-redhat-linux"" failed, resulting in an error. This, in turn, caused the RPM build to fail.

If you need to store a database password, a clear first step is to store the password outside the web tree. This can be done by encrypting the password and storing the encryption key in a separate location, requiring an attacker to obtain two distinct pieces of information. Furthermore, it is recommended to create a user account with limited access, rather than granting full privileges.

For enhanced security, consider creating a dedicated program that holds the database keys and allows the web program to interact with IT through a restricted protocol. This program can be designed to only perform necessary operations, adding specific operations as needed. Although this approach may incur a performance hit, it improves data isolation."

Physics engines do more than just knock over boxes,  however, and the interface between your game and a physics engine must be  fairly complex in order to harness advanced functionality. ",0,"
As game developers strive to innovate and perfect established genres, the trend of licensing physics engines has become increasingly essential. However, it's crucial to recognize that physics engines serve a purpose that goes beyond merely knocking over objects. The interface between your game and a physics engine must be highly sophisticated to fully utilize advanced features.

By embracing the concept of licensing physics engines, game developers can unlock a world of creative possibilities and push the boundaries of what's considered standard gameplay. The intricate interface required to harness the advanced functionality of a physics engine is a testament to the complexity and depth that such a collaboration can provide.

In essence, the synergy between a game and a physics engine is a key factor in driving innovation and elevating the overall gaming experience. As the industry continues to evolve, it's essential for developers to recognize the value of licensing physics engines and to explore the vast opportunities that such collaborations can bring."

This can be achieved by making a choice to reject the destructive influence of psychosis or neurosis.

As I reflect on this concept, I'm reminded of the wisdom of Ven Joan Shikai Woodward, who so eloquently expressed the importance of self-discovery. Her words serve as a powerful reminder that we have the power to create a more meaningful and fulfilling life.

For those interested in exploring this idea further, I'd like to share a fascinating resource: Women in Zen, a website that delves into the intersection of Zen Buddhism and femininity. The insights and perspectives shared on this site offer a compelling exploration of the role of women in Zen tradition.

As we embark on this journey of self-discovery, let us remember the wise words of Picasso, who so astutely observed that computers are unable to provide true answers, but rather serve as a means to discover our own answers.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to you to propose an opportunity that could benefit both parties. As you may know, my father, the late Chief Foday Sankoh of Sierra Leone, was tragically killed by President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah in 1999. Prior to his passing, he entrusted me with a secret regarding his assets. Two sealed boxes were deposited in a private security company in Europe, containing 652 carats of blue rough cut diamond and $16.8 million. My father's foreign partner was aware of the contents, but not the security company.

We are seeking your assistance in facilitating the transfer of ownership of the two boxes. This would involve opening an account in your country and transferring the funds into it. Simultaneously, arrangements can be made to sell the sealed box containing the blue rough cut diamond. The security company does not know the contents of the boxes, and it is essential that this remains confidential.

As a token of gratitude, we are willing to offer up to 25% of the total sum to you, to cover your anticipated expenses. We would also like to request your help in investing our share until we can meet you in person. If this proposal is acceptable to you, please respond to this"

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to you in a confidential capacity as the Chairman of the Contract Review Committee of the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA). I am reaching out to you with an extraordinary proposal that requires your cooperation.

Recently, our committee has uncovered an unclaimed contract entitlement with the Central Bank of Nigeria amounting to USD 71,500,000. This sum is an over-invoice contract payment currently held in an offshore account. To facilitate the withdrawal of this fund, we require a partner to assume the role of the contractor who has executed the contract.

In exchange for your assistance, we propose a sharing ratio of 1.70% for our committee, 2.20% for you as the partner, and 10% for expenses incurred during the transaction. This arrangement is necessary due to the fact that, as civil servants, we are prohibited from operating foreign accounts.

If you are interested in this proposal, please respond promptly with the following information:

1. The name you wish to use as the beneficiary of the fund
2. Your confidential phone and fax numbers

Further discussions will focus on the transfer of the funds and provide details on how to accomplish this opportunity.

Thank you for considering our proposal. Best regards,
George Osawa"

With this powerful CD, you will be able to investigate your friends, enemies and lovers in just minutes using the Internet.  You can track down old flames from college, or you can dig up some dirt on your boss to make sure you get that next promotion!    Or maybe you want a fake diploma to hang on your bedroom wall.

Using the Banned CD, you will learn how to build a completely  new identity. Obviously, the Powers That Be don&#x27;t want you to have the Banned CD.

Dear recipient,

I'd like to clarify the purpose and intentions behind the Banned CD. As the sender, I've been receiving messages claiming that my activities are contributing to the moral decay of society. However, I firmly believe that the CD's unique content provides valuable information that can empower individuals to make informed decisions.

The CD offers insights and tools to help people track down old acquaintances, uncover information about their bosses, and even build a new identity. I understand that this may not align with the interests of certain authorities, who have threatened me with legal action to stop selling the CD. Nonetheless, I believe that individuals have the right to access this type of information, and I'm committed to ensuring their freedom to make informed choices.

The CD offers a range of tools, including fake diplomas, identity-building strategies, and methods to avoid debt collectors, lawsuits, and other forms of pressure. I believe that this information can provide a sense of liberation and empowerment, especially for those who are seeking to take control of their lives.

If you're interested in learning more about the Banned CD and its capabilities, I invite you to explore the provided URL for more information.

"re : 6 . 108 sum : words that are their own opposites ( part 2 ) i &#x27; ve been enjoying the discussion of words that are their own antonyms . at first i thought the classic example of latin altus &quot; high &quot; or &quot; deep &quot; might fit in , but as i thought about it i figured it was just unmarked for point of view ( say when cleaning out an empty swimming pool then &quot; deep &quot; becomes &quot; high &quot; ) so i just looked to see if it was on the list and got a comment . no . good . but one that i have long wondered about is &quot; risk &quot; as in &quot; he risked winning the game &quot; . i was shocked ( as a teenager ) the first time i saw &quot; he risked losing the game &quot; ( or something like that ) in print , because i previously thought ( and am still inclined toward ) the complement of risk being the desirable result , not the undesirable one . whether or not this fits into this discussion , i wonder if anyone else has had a similar ( or opposite ) reaction or any thoughts about what &#x27;s going on in the case of &quot; risk &quot; . benji",0,"Dear Benji,

I've been enjoying the discussion about words that are their own opposites, and I'd like to contribute my thoughts on the matter. Initially, I thought examples like Latin ""altus"" (meaning ""high"" or ""deep"") might fit the bill. However, I realized that it's merely a matter of perspective (e.g., when cleaning an empty swimming pool, ""deep"" becomes ""high""). I decided to look into it further and noticed it wasn't on the list.

One example that I've long pondered is the word ""risk."" In the context of a game, someone ""risked winning"" the game. Yet, I was startled (as a teenager) to see ""he risked losing the game"" in print, as I previously thought the complement of risk was the desirable outcome, not the undesirable one.

I'd love to hear if others have had a similar reaction or any thoughts on what's occurring in the case of ""risk."" It's fascinating to explore how our understanding of certain words can shift over time.

"query : stieber &#x27;s law if i may , i would like to repeat a query i posted some time ago to which i received no responses : does anybody know who first proposed that analogical change cannot introduce new phonemic contrasts into a language ? the earliest reference i have found is a paper by z . stieber , written in polish in the 1930 &#x27;s , but i think this must go back further . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - i did receive one response ( from harry bochner ) regarding possible counterexamples to this , namely , it has been assumed that glottalized / y / in navaho is always of analogical origin . there are numerous other claimed examples of this in the literature , but most of them appear to be quite spurious ( e . g . , ukrainian and belorussian / dzh / ( voiced alveolopalatal affricate ) mentioned by jakobson , and certain umlauted vowels in swiss german mentioned by moulton and kiparsky ) .",0,"In an effort to clarify a previous query, I would like to rephrase my question: Who is credited with the idea that analogical change cannot introduce new phonemic contrasts into a language? I was initially directed to a paper by Z. Stieber, written in Polish in the 1930s, but I suspect that this concept has a more extensive history.

After receiving a response from Harry Bochner regarding potential counterexamples, I would like to revisit the topic. It was mentioned that the glottalized /y/ in Navajo is often considered an analogical origin. I have found other reported instances of this phenomenon in the literature, but most seem to be unreliable, such as the examples mentioned by Jakobson (Ukrainian and Belorussian /dzh/) and Moulton and Kiparsky (certain umlauted vowels in Swiss German)."

Dear friend,

I want to start by expressing my condolences for your condition. It's unfortunate to hear that you're struggling with esophageal cancer and have only a few months left to live. I understand that you're not looking for pity, and I want to acknowledge your words that everyone will die someday.

As you reflect on your life, I sense a sense of regret for the choices you've made. It's clear that your focus on your business has led you to neglect relationships and personal growth. However, it's never too late to make amends and change your ways. Your decision to give to charity organizations is a testament to this.

I'm willing to help you with collecting the remaining funds from the finance/security company. You've trusted me with this task, and I appreciate your willingness to entrust me with your last good deed. I understand that you've set aside 25% for me and my time, and I accept this gesture.

Please provide me with the necessary information regarding the finance/security company, and I'll do my best to facilitate the transfer of the funds to the charity organizations. I'll also ensure that your wishes are respected, and the remaining amount is distributed according to your instructions.

I'll await your response soon.

Yours"

"When a settler goes postal and kills some Palestinians they are treated as a criminal, not celebrated in word and song.But you knew that.When a Palestinian sets out, to great rejoicing, to attempt to target children with a homicide-bomb, they are careful to dip the shrapnel in rat poison.  It helps prevent blood clotting in the victims, you see.I&#x27;m sure all those Jewish homicide-bombers do the same.  Oh wait, there aren&#x27;t any.If the Palestinians are driven completely out, either by expulsion or death, they will have nobody to blame but themselves.

Dear fellow, I'd like to express my concerns regarding the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. It's crucial to acknowledge the harm and suffering inflicted upon innocent civilians, regardless of their ethnicity or religion. 

Rather than perpetuating hatred and violence, I suggest we focus on promoting peace and understanding through open dialogue and respectful engagement. We must also recognize the historical injustices and systemic inequalities that have contributed to this cycle of violence.

It's essential to address the root causes of this conflict, including the displacement and marginalization of Palestinians. We must work towards a two-state solution, ensuring the rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their nationality or creed.

I'm appalled by the reports of settlers and Palestinian militants engaging in violence against civilians, including the use of harmful tactics like rat poison. Such actions are morally reprehensible and only serve to further entrench the conflict.

It's crucial that we support diplomatic efforts and engage in constructive discussions to resolve this crisis. We must also acknowledge the suffering and trauma experienced by all parties involved and work towards healing and reconciliation.

I propose that we focus on empowering marginalized communities, promoting economic development, and enhancing education and healthcare infrastructure. This will help alleviate the root causes of this conflict and create a more just and equitable society for"

I'd like to offer you an affordable software solution. Instead of investing in expensive software, I'd like to suggest a more budget-friendly option that meets your needs. This software, unlike some others on the market, doesn't rely on complex and confusing instructions, making it user-friendly and easy to understand.

Walgreen's software is not designed for everyone, especially not for those looking for low-cost alternatives. Additionally, I don't think it's necessary to focus on the past or past experiences when discussing software. Instead, I believe it's more important to look at the present and future.

The software I'm proposing is more than just a tool - it's a solution that can help you simplify your workflow and improve your productivity. It's designed to be easy to use, with a user-friendly interface that's free from unnecessary complexity.

I'd be happy to facilitate a conversation about the software and its benefits. If you're interested, I can set up a call to discuss further.

Best,

Oh Gary, I'm not sure if I'd go so far as to say that the article is 'hate lit' - it's an interesting, albeit a bit troubling theory. While it's not touchy-feely or liberal-friendly, I wouldn't necessarily say it's hate lit. What's troubling about the article is the subtext hate-lit propaganda it presents. The scary thing is that it's not being seen as such. The author's only problem with the article is that it's some of the most alarming hate-lit propaganda they've seen come out of the US since the March of Tears. I know I'll get flak for saying this, but I think it's worth pointing out. Best regards,

I recently stumbled upon a remarkable computer science research paper and wanted to share some fascinating insights with you. The paper introduced me to the concept of a public vertical search portal, specifically http://hpsearch.uni-trier.de/hp, which is a collection of 62,179 computer scientists' home pages. Although many of the pages are broken, I was surprised to find that 50% of the title hits are better than those on DBLP.

What caught my attention was the results from Google's ""Similar Pages"" feature. For instance, the only relevant result is the FoRK Archive page, which sparked my interest. Other similar results included pages on printer toner, home mortgages, and an intriguing concept known as the ""prime radiant."" As it turns out, the prime radiant is an Asimov concept that represents a single, interconnected FoRKlist, connecting decentralized individuals worldwide who share collective wisdom. This collective wisdom is a promising model for predicting the future.

I came across this concept while exploring the homepage of Gregory Alan Bolcer, CTO of Endeavors Technology. I'm interested in exploring this idea further and hope you'll join me in this journey of discovery.

In response to Richard Sproat's question about ""phonemic"" orthography, I would like to clarify that the concept of a ""phonemic"" orthography is virtually non-existent. While language planners may occasionally impose a spelling reform, such as in the cases of Czech or Dutch, these efforts are short-lived, and orthography inevitably diverges from pronunciation as language evolves. It is troublesome that the term ""grapheme"" is often used without a clear understanding of its meaning, particularly in contrast to the more well-defined ""phoneme"".

I have written extensively on this topic, publishing an article in the 18th Lacus Forum (1991) and subsequent discussion in the 21st Lacus Forum (1994). A survey focused on the phonological encoding of writing systems, as requested by R. Sproat, will be available later this year with the publication of ""The World's Writing Systems"", co-edited by myself and William Bright, published by Oxford University Press. The book explores how writing systems encode the phonologies of major languages, and I urge you to take advantage of the pre-publication discount price of $100, available until August 31st.

I recently discussed the MBR restoration with Liam Bedford and Ciaran Mac Lochlainn. As it turns out, the DOS command 'fdisk /mbr' will restore the MBR, leaving the partitions untouched. However, the Linux equivalent, 'lilo -u /dev/hda,' requires a copy of the MBR in the '/boot' directory, which is not always available.

To clarify, the DOS command 'fdisk /mbr' is not compatible with Linux's fdisk command, which does not have an option for /mbr. Instead, we can use 'lilo -u /dev/hda' (unless John Reilly's suggestion from yesterday is correct). However, this method also requires a copy of the MBR in the '/boot' directory, which was not available during the installation of Linux Mandrake.

I'm grateful for the clarification on the fdisk issue. As a reminder, there is no hidden switch for fdisk. I hope this clears up any confusion.

I understand that this can be frustrating, especially when trying to find ease in your daily activities. I recently spoke with your doctor, and we came up with an idea to symbolically represent the situation. Unfortunately, our friend with whom we were supposed to meet last week had to roll back, and we were left with a base to stand on. We were able to get an answer to our question, which was that the number to reach for assistance is two. We were also informed that it may take some time to get a plain response. We've sent a letter to fill in the gap, but it seems like we're sailing in the desert without a ship to carry us. The sun seems to be beating down on us, and nothing appears to be within reach. It's as if we're trying to fly among clouds without an anchor to hold onto.

At first glance, the case against Saddam seems airtight, with the government's claims of chemical and biological weapons, as well as connections to terrorism. However, upon closer examination, several key points raise questions regarding the reliability of the information presented. 

For instance, the dossier relies heavily on outdated intelligence, which could be outdated or even fabricated. Furthermore, the alleged connections to terrorism appear to be based on circumstantial evidence rather than concrete proof. 

I'd like to stress that these criticisms are not intended to imply that Saddam Hussein is innocent of any wrongdoing. Instead, it's essential to scrutinize the evidence presented to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the information. 

I'd appreciate any feedback on my analysis, particularly from those familiar with the subject matter.

As we continue to unravel the mysteries of the universe, groundbreaking research has shed new light on our understanding of the cosmos. Two significant findings have given us a deeper insight into the workings of the universe, providing what we call ""two new windows on the universe.""

One of these discoveries involves the detection of gravitational waves, which are ripples in the fabric of space-time that were first predicted by Einstein a century ago. This finding has allowed us to glimpse into the universe's early days, witnessing the explosion of stars and the formation of galaxies.

The second breakthrough concerns the observation of fast-moving stars in the distant reaches of the universe. By studying these stars, we've been able to map the universe's evolution over billions of years, gaining invaluable insights into the formation and growth of galaxies.

These findings not only deepen our understanding of the universe but also have far-reaching implications for our understanding of time, space, and the fundamental laws of physics. They also highlight the ongoing importance of astrophysical research in expanding our knowledge of the cosmos.

I invite you to join me in celebrating these incredible advancements and exploring the wonders they hold for our understanding of the universe.

I am seeking clarification on some points from the PRC meeting agenda recap. I believe there was a misunderstanding on the following items: 
1. The accomplishments by June 19th are only for Directors and above, and will be communicated to you. 
2. Individual groups under your supervision will set their deadlines prior to presenting to the smaller PRC groups. 
3. I did not understand that promotions will be discussed prior to the meeting with you, and also thought that the employee must have been in their role for at least one year before being considered for promotion.

Dear Sir,

I am writing to propose a partnership opportunity that I believe will be of great interest to you. I came across your contact while conducting research for a reliable foreign partner who can assist my family and I in transferring funds to a personal or private account for investment purposes.

I am Mr. Philip Wonyane, the son of the late Mr. John Wonyane, who was the chairman of the farmer's co-operation in Zimbabwe. My father was a prominent figure in Zimbabwe, and after his death, we were forced to leave the country due to the danger posed by the money he kept in his hidden safe. This money, amounting to $13 million, was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and establishment of new farms in Swaziland.

After my father's death, we moved to South Africa and deposited this money in a security company as valuables belonging to our foreign partner. I have made arrangements with the security company to transfer the deposit to an overseas country, ensuring the fund's safety due to political instability in Africa.

I am seeking your assistance in receiving this deposit as the final receiver/beneficiary in any country. You will also be given the code/password for release, which will be handed over to wh"

I agree that configuring SpamAssassin to set the precedence to ""low"" for spam messages and then filtering on that could be an effective approach. Daniel, I like your suggestion to use a ""Precedence: junk"" header, as most software already recognizes it and Courier and Outlook handle these special headers. The link provided, [1] Malte's Moronic Mail Autoresponders (A FAQ From Hell), also suggests that using the ""Precedence: junk"" header can prevent bounce messages.

Additionally, Daniel's mention of the original intention of the Precedence header, which affects Sendmail's queuing system, is interesting.

Best regards,

I've been using your product for four months now, and I'm thrilled to report that it's had a significant impact on my sex life. Not only have I noticed a significant increase in length, going from 2 to nearly 6 inches, but my girlfriend has been impressed as well. She loves the results, but she's not aware of what I do to achieve them – she thinks it's natural.

I'm grateful for the realistic gains I've experienced with your product, and I'm confident that it will continue to help me pleasure my partner every time. I'm sure you'll be pleased to know that my sex life has been transformed, and I'm now able to be a stud.

However, I was awoken from my slumber this morning by a series of strange noises – hoarse screams and the sound of blades spinning, like a giant windmill. I'm not sure what caused the commotion, but I'm glad to be back in bed, safe and sound.

Thanks again for your product. I'm excited to continue using it and enjoying the benefits it provides.

Dear List,

I'm thrilled that you're satisfied with Mail-SpamAssassin's performance in most cases. However, I understand that there are some exceptions, like your situation, where additional effort is required.

To help troubleshoot the issue, I've been debugging the spamc source code by adding printf statements wherever exit code 74 is used. I've attached the modified spamc code for your testing. Please try it out and see if it resolves the problem.

For your reference, here's the output when connecting to the spamc service using telnet:

Dear David,

We have reached an agreement in principle on the changes to the ""standard"" contract form with UBS. We have agreed to the following modifications:

1. The involuntary termination clause will now state that all contracts will be subject to a 90-day notice period, with 99% of the wording agreed upon.

2. The ""free"" option period has been changed from March 15 to March 22, and is now a mutual option with wording agreed upon to 95%.

3. The non-compete clause has been revised to exclude references to Enron and instead focus on Netco and Ena, with 50% of the wording agreed upon.

4. The miscellaneous clause has been changed to specify that the employee representative knows of no claims, grievances, and is now limited to individual matters, with 100% of the wording agreed upon.

5. The recognition of prior Enron service has been added to the contracts, with wording lifted from the offer letter and 100% of the wording agreed upon.

Please note that the contracts will be delayed until the wording is finally signed off by lawyers, which we expect to occur within the next three hours. It is essential that we finalize the changes now, as any further changes will significantly delay"

"&gt; &gt; GAB&gt; The problem is that politics have gotten so muddied &gt; GAB&gt; nowadays, that shouting down and unpeaceably disrupting &gt; GAB&gt; political rallies that you don&#x27;t agree with has become &gt; GAB&gt; common practice.  The courts have constantly ruled &gt; GAB&gt; that there are some restrictions on the first amendment. &gt; GAB&gt; They teach you that your very first year of law school. &gt; &gt; I&#x27;ll agree with Owen on this one.  Muddied my ass.  How hard is it to &gt; chose between a Republocrat or a Demipublican?   Not very.  Shouting &gt; down has grown to become the answer because the government, over a &gt; span of years, and with the help of the Courts -has- limited the &gt; rights we have as citizens under the First Amendment.Wishful thinking. People are just bigger dickheads now. Culture is changing and it is becoming acceptable to get in peoples face and shout them down when you disagree with them.  The people that do this are NOT disenfranchised. They get their rocks off on being disagreeable assholes. The act of protesting is more important than the actual issue being protested for most of these people.&gt; question the policy about terrorism, or drugs, or Iraq, or Bush in &gt; general, you&#x27;re aiding terrorism.   If you challenge the beliefs of &gt; the folks attending the various shadowy G8 conferences, you&#x27;re an &gt; anarchist, and you&#x27;re herded off to a &#x27;designated protest spot&#x27; miles &gt; away from anything.   Part of the point of speech is to be -heard-. &gt; I can scream on my soapbox in the forest somewhere, and while thats &gt; speech, its not effective speech.  People are screaming and shouting &gt; over the political figures because they cannot be  heard in any other &gt; way.And where does this end? Shouting down speakers is an obviously stupid tactic if they are -really- interested in advocating change. Are they such clueless social morons that they don&#x27;t see this or are they just interested in stroking their pathetic egos?OBTW, &#x27;clueless social moron syndrom&#x27; does not have political boundaries.Bill ",0,"As I understand, you're concerned about the rise of political rallies being disrupted by shouting down speakers who don't agree with the protesters. You believe this is becoming a common practice due to the government and courts limiting First Amendment rights over the years. You argue that this behavior has become acceptable, allowing people to disregard civil discourse and shout down opposing views.

In your opinion, this shouting down is not an effective way to advocate change, as it's not allowing for genuine discussion and debate. You question the intentions of those who engage in this behavior, wondering if they're driven by a desire to be disagreeable or if they're genuinely interested in addressing the issues at hand.

You also mention the restrictions on free speech, citing the need for some limitations on the First Amendment. You believe that the courts have consistently ruled on this, and it's something that's been taught in law school.

Finally, you express frustration with the idea that people are more likely to shout down opposing views rather than engage in respectful dialogue."

Dear All,

I am writing to bring to your attention a matter regarding the delivery of meter 1520, specifically the payment terms for the services provided. As you are aware, the deal should be flowing, and I have recently created a new deal ticket for May 2000. However, I was under the impression that the agreement was an evergreen contract.

Could you please advise on the current status of the deal and whether we should be charging a premium rate for the services provided? As of my knowledge cutoff, historically, we have been charging $0.60 per million cubic meters for this transport.

Please coordinate with each other to determine who should be responsible for rolling this deal or clarify if it should not be flowing. Additionally, if there is any confusion regarding the deal ticket in Sitara, please let me know.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Best regards,

"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85481504 Date: Not suppliedCarny concessionaires have taken to selling deep-friend Twinkies, doing big  business with artery-clogging horripilations:     In what may be the biggest setback for the war on fat since supersize      fries, Americans are scarfing down thousands of the gooey, calorie-laden      snack cakes at county fairs and restaurants across the country.     &quot;We sold 26,000 Twinkies in 18 days. People drove for hours just to taste      our Twinkie,&quot; said Rocky Mullen, who sells the deep-fried, cream-filled      treats for $3 (U.S.) each at the Payallup Fair, 50 kilometres south of      Seattle.     As if Twinkies are not sweet enough already, vendors such as Mr. Mullen add      chocolate or berry sauce and sprinkle powdered sugar on top...     Hearing about Mr. Sell&#x27;s invention, Hostess, the company that makes the      71-year-old snack, started promoting deep-fried Twinkies to state and      county fairs, where a captive population of junk-food addicts began      gobbling them up between pig races and tractor-pull competitions.     How bad are they for your health? After deep-frying, a Twinkie packs an      estimated 400 calories and 28 grams of fat.

The snack, which consists of the classic Twinkie paired with chocolate or berry sauce and powdered sugar, has become a huge attraction. Vendors are selling thousands of these gooey, calorie-laden treats, with some locations reporting over 26,000 sold in just 18 days.

While the initial reaction to this artery-clogging snack might be excitement, it's essential to consider the health implications. After being deep-fried, a Twinkie contains an estimated 400 calories and 28 grams of fat. This could be the biggest setback for the war on fat since supersized fries, as Americans continue to indulge in these tasty but unhealthy treats.

It's unclear what the long-term effects of this snack trend will be, but it's clear that the demand is high. We'll be keeping a close eye on this development and its potential impact on our health."

This concept is quite easy to demonstrate. For instance, a publication could randomize all letters, keeping the first two and last two letters the same, without significantly affecting readability. My analysis did not produce surprising results because the prevailing theory at the time focused on shape and sentence recognition.

var training assessment attached is my quick assessment of the var training .,0,"Please find attached my quick assessment of the VAR training. I have evaluated the course based on its relevance to the job requirements and overall learning experience.

The assessment highlights both strengths and areas for improvement in the training, including suggestions for enhancing the content, delivery, and effectiveness of the course. I have also provided a rating system to help identify specific aspects that require attention.

In my opinion, the training is well-structured, and the instructor did an excellent job of engaging the participants. However, I suggest that more hands-on activities and real-world examples be incorporated to make the training more practical and applicable to the workplace.

I would like to emphasize that this is an initial assessment, and I believe that further feedback from participants and instructors would be valuable in refining the training. I am happy to discuss my findings with anyone interested and provide additional recommendations.

Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss this assessment further.

I appreciate your interest in the contract awarding process in the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy in South Africa. I understand that your committee oversaw the awarding of contracts to foreign firms, and I'm intrigued by your proposal to use my banking account to claim an over-inflated sum.

According to your email, the sum of $25,600,000 was over invoiced, and the actual contractors have since been paid off. You're seeking a trusted foreign partner like myself to facilitate the transfer of funds. You propose a share structure of 75% for you and your partners, 20% for using my account, and 5% for upfront expenses.

Before proceeding, I would like to clarify the details and procedures of this transaction. Could you kindly furnish me with the necessary documentation and formalities that justify my involvement as the rightful owner of this fund? Additionally, I would appreciate any information regarding the legitimacy of this proposal and the potential risks involved.

Please provide your phone and fax numbers so that we can discuss this matter further.

Yours faithfully,

"linguistics and imperialism it &#x27;s probably true that linguistics tends to thrive in circumstances of imperialism , but the reason is not that linguistics is inherently imperialistic by nature . when does linguistics happen ? when a society with a literate culture comes into contact with peoples speaking other languages , and takes an interest in them . imperialism provides one situation in which this can occur , but not the only one . bob hoberman rhoberman @ ccmail . sunysb . edu",0,"
It's likely that linguistics tends to flourish in contexts of imperialism, but not because linguistics is inherently imperialistic. Instead, linguistics occurs when a literate society encounters a culture speaking a different language and takes an interest in learning more. While imperialism can provide one such scenario, it's not the only one. For instance, cross-cultural communication, scholarly pursuits, or personal interactions can also lead to the development of linguistics.

"&gt; That always amazes me about &#x27;regular&#x27; dreams - how often they come true. &gt; In 1993 or so, when I was a student in Edinburgh, I had a bad dream about being chased around a house by a scary murderous tramp who was carrying a bag full of half-penny coins (which had long since ceased to be legal tender). The next morning as I left the flat, I found a half-penny on the doormat right outside our door. Fair gave me the willies, that did.TimC------------------------ Yahoo!

For instance, I had a particularly vivid dream when I was a student in Edinburgh, back in 1993 or so. The dream involved being relentlessly chased around a house by a frightening and murderous vagrant who was carrying a sack filled with half-penny coins. The strange thing is that half-penny coins were no longer in circulation at the time.

The next morning, as I left my flat, I was startled to find a half-penny lying on the doorstep just outside our door. To say the least, it was an unsettling experience.

I'm not sure what to make of it, but it's certainly an unusual experience that has stayed with me to this day. Perhaps dreams have a way of revealing hidden truths or influencing the subconscious, but in this case, the encounter left me with more questions than answers."

I apologize if my previous response was unclear or unsatisfying. To clarify, I'm suggesting that the main issue is not with your use of Razor, but rather with the misconfiguration of your qmail server. This may have allowed untrusted strangers to relay spam through your server.

If you're determined to use Razor to address this problem, I recommend combining it with qmail-scanner and SpamAssassin. The former provides a framework for qmail integration, which includes Razor checks. However, please be aware that this approach will be more resource-intensive than simply denying relaying privileges to all but trusted users.

For more information on configuring qmail to properly restrict relaying, I recommend consulting the qmail documentation and searching for the ""qmail newbie's guide to relaying."" This should be your first stop for any qmail-related questions.

I wanted to bring to your attention an important development in the government's recent policy decisions. As you may know, there has been an increase in the number of secondments from the energy, arms, and construction industries. While this development may seem positive on the surface, it is crucial that we acknowledge the government's intention to keep this information hidden from the public.

Despite the perceived benefits, it is essential to question the motives behind this sudden surge in secondments. I am concerned that the government's attempt to conceal this information may be indicative of ulterior motives, which could have far-reaching consequences.

I urge you to investigate this matter further and demand transparency from our government. It is crucial that we, as citizens, are aware of the decisions that impact our lives and the direction of our society.

Dear Owen,

I stumbled upon an interesting fact from the local paper this morning. It seems that Canadians consume approximately seven times as many doughnuts per capita compared to Americans. This is quite surprising, considering our Canadian fondness for variety in franchise food.

In my opinion, the limited choices in our market, dominated by the likes of Wendy's, KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, and Tim Hortons (all Pepsi companies, aren't they?), significantly impact our gastronomic scene. When New Yorkers enjoy biscotti, we Canadians can only opt for a timbit, as that's the only option available. This scarcity of choice limits our culinary experience.

As a nation built on the principles of creative free enterprise and entrepreneurship, I believe it's crucial for us to break away from this monopoly and offer more diverse choices to the Canadian people.

According to a recent study published on NewsIsFree.com, a new class of drugs aimed at preventing complications related to diabetes may achieve its goal by slowing down the accelerated aging process. The findings suggest that these medications might not only benefit individuals with diabetes but potentially also delay the symptoms of aging in the general population.

The research highlights the connection between diabetes and aging, showing that the disease progression is closely linked to the acceleration of the aging process. By targeting this relationship, the new drugs aim to improve the quality of life for those with diabetes and potentially offer a breakthrough in the quest for age-related disease prevention.

As our readers may know, NewsIsFree.com is a trusted source for scientific news and updates. Their recent article on the topic, dated [Date], offers a comprehensive overview of the study's findings and implications.

I believe this breakthrough has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of aging and its relationship to diabetes. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this topic further with your readers.

Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions or for more information.

"Normally, I disdain any kind of mysticism, even when it is associated  with fairly good ideas.  Just a big turnoff.  A good example would be  the difference between Yoga/TM and the more scientifically pure, but  related, relaxation techniques including &quot;betagenics&quot;,  hypnosis/auto-hypnosis, etc.  (This was one of the many topics I  obsessively absorbed as a teenager.)  Or Tai Chi etc. vs. Tai Bo /  G-Force Dyno-Staff.I have to say however that, having found this while looking for  something completely unrelated, it has some cute truisms.  I  particularly like their addiction to non-addiction.  Additionally, the  Mindprod treehugger site has some interesting quotes, etc.To my internal ear, nearly all of these 60&#x27;s based new-age vernacular  seem to assume that you are a simple child (of the 60&#x27;s?) who needs some  religion-like couching of ideas to relate and internalize.  Very  irritating, but taken in small doses it&#x27;s interesting to compare and  contrast with our (my) modern mental models.I found that a few of the principles could be used to explain and  justify US/UN foreign policy and actions.http://mindprod.com/methods.html http://members.aol.com/inossence/Kenkey.html http://www.mindprod.com/ (Apologies for the embedded HTML.)We create the world we live in.

I recently came across a web page that resonated with me, despite my skepticism towards new-age concepts. The page discussed various principles and ideas, some of which I found intriguing and others that irritated me. The authors' reliance on 60's-based vernacular and patronizing tone was off-putting, but I did find some interesting parallels between their philosophies and modern mental models.

As I delved deeper, I discovered that some of the principles could be applied to explain and justify foreign policy and actions. The notion that ""we create the world we live in"" and that ""a loving person lives in a loving world"" resonated with me. I also appreciated the idea that happiness can only be experienced in the present moment, when our consciousness is not dominated by addictions and demands.

However, I must admit that the overly simplistic language and the emphasis on spirituality and mysticism did not resonate with me. Nevertheless, I find it interesting to compare and contrast these ideas with my own modern mental models.

Below are the links to the websites that inspired this reflection: http://mindprod.com/methods.html http://members.aol.com/inossence/Kenkey.html http://www.mindprod.com/

"Yo Mark,Have you goten the closed source drivers from Nvidia or are you still using the wans that came with Redbum? http://www.nvidia.com and then somewhere...somwhere-else...Installation is WELL detailed, you should see the NV splash screen, don;t forget to edit the config files.CW -------------------------------------- HiI have just installed Red Hat 7.2 on my desktop machine.

My monitor is slightly miss-aligned and I cannot run any high resolution games ( everything freezes ). In the hardware browser in Gnome it lists my Graphics Card (Riva TNT2), and shows installed drivers...... maybe the problem lies elswhere.Another problem I have is that I cannot install my ISDN, USB modem ( LASAT Speed Basic ), however im pretty sure its not supported by Linux, but again it is featured in the Hardware Browser, without installed drivers.If anybody has any ideas, please let me know cos id like to use Linux more.

Hi Mark,

I'm having some issues with my newly installed Red Hat 7.2 on my desktop machine. As a Linux newbie, I've run into a few problems. The graphic display doesn't seem to be working properly, and my monitor is slightly misaligned. I'm also having trouble installing my ISDN, USB modem (LASAT Speed Basic), which is not supported by Linux, according to the hardware browser. I'm wondering if anyone has any ideas on how to resolve these issues.

I've checked the Nvidia website for closed-source drivers, but I haven't found any information on how to install them. I'm not sure if the problem lies with the drivers or somewhere else.

If you have any experience with Linux or know of any solutions, please let me know. I'm eager to use Linux more, but I'm struggling with these issues.

Thanks,
Mark

Hello,

I'm excited to share with you my personal story and what drives me to do what I do. On my website, I've written a little about myself, and I thought I'd share it with you here too. You can find more information about me on my about page.

I believe that sharing my story can help others feel less alone and more connected. It's a way to show that we're all in this together, and that everyone has their own struggles and triumphs. I hope that by sharing my story, I can inspire others to do the same.

This journey of self-discovery and growth has been incredibly rewarding, and I'm grateful to have the opportunity to share it with others. I hope you find my story inspiring and that it helps you connect with others who may be going through similar experiences.

Dear readers,

I am delighted to introduce the new issue of GLot International, Volume 3, Issue 5, edited by Lisa L. S. Cheng and Rint Sybesma. This special edition brings together a collection of thought-provoking articles, interviews, and book reviews that showcase the latest advancements in the field of linguistics.

Firstly, we feature an interview with renowned linguist James McCawley, who shares his insightful thoughts on X-bar syntax. His humorous remarks will have you laughing and thinking about the intricacies of linguistic theories.

Next, we have a state-of-the-art article by Marc van Oostendorp, ""Schwa in Phonological Theory,"" which delves into the fundamental requirements of schwa syllables compared to those of other vowels.

Our ""Column"" section welcomes Neil Smith, who explores the concept of ""Acquired Whining"" and its relevance to Chomsky's influence.

We also feature two dissertation reviews: ""The Syntax of Past Participles: A Generative Study of Nonfinite Constructions in Ancient and Modern Italian"" by Verner Egerland (Lund 1996) and ""Direct Object Scrambling in Dutch and Italian Child Language"" by Jeannette Schaeffer ("

It's easy to blame the system for our troubles, but we must take responsibility for our individual actions.

As we navigate life's challenges, it's essential to recognize that our greatest adversaries are often the products of our own imagination. The saying ""our day will come"" is a reminder that we must not let fear dictate our actions.

I have no desire to lead others, as the role is often thankless and filled with challenges. True leaders are those who take charge and lead by example.

Wise individuals don't require advice, as they possess the wisdom to make informed decisions. Fools, on the other hand, refuse to accept guidance, even when it's offered.

To succeed, we must cultivate inner strength, confidence, and hope. We can't give up, even in the face of adversity. Remember, morning always follows darkness, and perseverance is key to achieving our goals."

The initial response from CDale, Adam's friend, expresses surprise at how quickly Adam rushed to the computer to share his exciting news before attending to his pregnant wife. CDale jokingly threatens to kill Adam if he's responsible for his wife's poor experience during childbirth. 

CDale goes on to explain that the body's natural response to pain and the use of painkillers can help the mother forget the ordeal, allowing her to recall the experience more positively. This leads CDale to make a wry comment about the expectations surrounding sex, implying that men often underestimate the discomfort involved in childbirth. The tone is lighthearted, with a touch of humor and camaraderie between the friends."

I am writing to correct the mistakes I made in my previous posting about dependency grammar on the DG and HPSG lists. Despite the fact that I successfully posted the same topic earlier, at least two people have informed me that they were unable to access the files. The address to download the files is julius.ling.ohio-state.edu, and the file names have the suffix "".ps.gz"", which indicates they are compressed and need to be unzipped using the ""gunzip"" command. The directory address uses forward slashes (/) instead of backslashes (\).

I have put three responses to my previous posting in my inbox, but due to an unknown software error, I am unable to read my messages. However, I will try to answer the responses through this email.

To the respondent from Finland, you requested a numerical IP address, which is 128.146.172.200. Regarding the problem with Chapter 7, it has been corrected, but there may still be an issue with one or two examples. I can send an ASCII file or a paper copy of the examples if you provide your mail address.

To the respondent from Taiwan (or Hong Kong), you noted a problem with Chapter 7. The general issue has been resolved,"

I'd like to clarify the issue with my pthreads usage. Despite stopping the initial 50 threads, the memory usage remains high. When I start another 50 threads, the usage increases further.

It appears that the filters may have malfunctioned, allowing unwanted emails to flood our inboxes. I understand that it can be frustrating to deal with these issues.

To resolve this matter, I propose that we consider implementing restrictions on posting to ensure that only registered members can contribute to the discussions. This step would help minimize the occurrence of spam and maintain a cleaner, more focused conversation.

I acknowledge that my previous suggestion may have been perceived as insensitive, and I apologize if any offense was taken. My intention was to offer a practical solution to this problem, not to promote any sort of discrimination.

I would appreciate it if someone with the necessary expertise could assist in installing a spam filtering program, such as Spam Assassin, to help curb this issue. I believe this would be a more effective solution than relying solely on manual moderation.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this matter and working together to find a solution."

The regime and even the present civilian government are made up of Abacha&#x27;s enemies.Recently, the wife was banned from traveling outside Kano State their home state as a kind of house arrest and the eldest son still in detention.Although, a lot of money have been recovered from Mrs. Abacha since the death of her husband by the present government, there&#x27;s still huge sums of money in hard currencies that we have been able to move out of the country for safe keeping to the tune of US$50 million.This money US$50 Million is already in North American and if you are interested,we will prepare you as the beneficiary of the total funds,and you will share 25% of the total funds after clearance from the Security Company.Note, there is no risk involved in this project because l am involved as Abacha&#x27;s confidant.Please you should keep this transaction a top secret and we are prepared to do more business with you pending your approach towards this project.I await your urgent response.Thanks.

"die offs in areas with better records parallel and support the claims that European diseases were devastating to all American hemisphere populations, and the reverse was never true.

It was up here in the North or in the Amazon where I&#x27;m a little more suspicious of very high upward revisions.At least that was my take.I have never heard anyone seriously argue that European diseases were not a significant factor, or that there were not in fact a lot of Aztec people prior to Cortez.

However, I did discover that Armey has been known to make provocative statements, often with a strong emphasis on politics.

Regarding the time gap between the error and correction, I couldn't find any public records or reliable sources detailing Armey's previous mistakes. It's possible that the error was corrected internally or was not publicly reported.

As for the prosody, I couldn't find any information on a song called ""Begin the Harangue"" with a hard 'g'. It's possible that the song doesn't exist or is a lesser-known tune. I couldn't find any connections between Armey and Bill King, a professor at the University of Arizona, despite their shared interest in linguistics.

Finally, I must note that my pronunciations of public figures, including Barney Frank, are merely educated guesses and should not be taken as definitive.

If you require further assistance or would like to explore this topic further, please feel free to ask.

As part of an ongoing joint project between NASA and the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH), Dr. John Christy and Dr. Roy Spencer are analyzing data gathered by microwave sounding units (MSUs) on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) TIROS-N satellites to provide accurate and direct measurements of atmospheric temperatures globally. Their research shows a cooling trend of 0.03 degrees Celsius per decade since the first NOAA TIROS-N satellites were launched.

However, some researchers continue to use computer models to predict global warming and related extreme weather events, despite the limitations of their accuracy. These models often predict cooling in certain regions, which is then incorporated into the broader narrative of global warming. Meanwhile, the satellite data reveal a lack of consistency in the way temperature readings are taken, and urbanization may be causing local temperature increases that are misinterpreted as global climate change.

A study from Vienna found long-term warming at an airport location, but not at other sites, and another study from Antarctica was later found to be influenced by the timing of the airplane's measurements. This highlights the importance of considering the potential biases in temperature data and the need for more reliable and accurate measurements.

neon week 8 - experiencing god week 8 . doc,0,"

I am writing to share my reflection on the past week's experience of ""Experiencing God"" as we entered our eighth week of Neon. Our discussions, worship sessions, and personal reflections have profoundly impacted my understanding of God's presence in my life.

During this week, we explored the concept of ""seeking"" God. Our group discussions revealed how each person's perspective on seeking God is shaped by their unique experiences and perspectives. This insight has led me to recognize that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to seeking God. It's essential to be patient, trust in God's sovereignty, and cultivate a willingness to listen and learn.

One of the most significant takeaways for me was the understanding that seeking God is not a one-time event but a continuous process. This has given me a renewed sense of purpose and responsibility to prioritize my spiritual growth. I am committed to deepening my relationship with God and allowing Him to transform me into a vessel for His work.

I would like to express my gratitude to our leaders and facilitators for creating a safe and engaging environment that fosters meaningful connections and spiritual growth. I am excited to continue our journey together and explore the depths of God's love.

May God continue to guide and direct us as we seek"

"ethylene margin collar simulation model i set up the simulation model . the margin follows a mean - reverting process . i seperarted the data into two category , margin &gt; 0 . 04 and margin &lt; 0 . 04 . then i estimate the mean reverting speed seperately for these two data sets . i got higher mean reverting speed than that i estimated using the whole data set . the high mr speed surpresses the probability at high payout side . since the mr speed is sensitive to where i divide the data , so bob will run a few senarios . i put the overal settlement cap and floor into the montly premium calculation , so the the result in el 8 on the summary page is the ultimate answer to the deal pricing . i also calculate the undiscounted payout distribution and overall collar worth . relax the overall cap and floor will have a direct comparison with the spread option approach that bob and lee set up . look like we got a reasonable model . stinson : i &#x27; d like to have you check my set up for the simulation model . lee and douglas : you can play with the model , and let me know what do you think . bob : we need run different price curve senarios using the simulation model . plus different mr speed . zimin",0,"I'd like to summarize the key findings from our collar simulation model. As you know, I set up the model to account for the mean-reverting process of our margin data. I divided the data into two categories: margin greater than 0.04 and margin less than 0.04. After estimating the mean-reverting speed separately for each dataset, I found that the estimated speeds were higher than our initial expectations. This has resulted in a lower probability of high-payout outcomes.

To further investigate this phenomenon, Bob will run various scenarios using the simulation model. I've also included the overall settlement cap and floor in the monthly premium calculation, which will yield the ultimate deal pricing in EL 8 on the summary page. Additionally, I've calculated the undiscounted payout distribution and overall collar worth.

If we relax the overall cap and floor, we can directly compare our results with the spread option approach set up by Bob and Lee. It appears that our model is reasonable, and I'd appreciate any feedback from Stinson, Lee, and Douglas.

Please take some time to review my setup for the simulation model, and feel free to experiment with different parameters and mean-reverting speeds. I'm looking forward to your input."

"hi hello , those &quot; fat &quot; mortgage payments are unhealthy . . . . lose a little weight from your &quot; fat &quot; mortgage payments . the 60 second refinance diet plan . rickie oakes if you are happy with your current interest rates you can go here for optout http : / / www . xmaslowrate . com / x / st . html",1,"Hi Sir/Madam,

I wanted to reach out to you about your current mortgage payments. As I'm sure you're aware, the significant interest rates you're paying are affecting your financial health. It's like having an extra ""weight"" on your shoulders, making it challenging to make ends meet.

I'd like to introduce you to the ""60-second refinance diet plan"" - a simple and effective way to ""lose a little weight"" from your mortgage payments. This plan can help you refinance your mortgage and reduce your interest rates, making your payments more manageable.

If you're happy with your current rates, you can opt out and continue with your current mortgage. However, if you're willing to explore alternatives, I can provide you with more information on how to refinance your mortgage and potentially save money.

Please feel free to reach out to me, Rickie Oakes, to discuss your options. You can also visit our website at http://www.xmaslowrate.com/x/st.html for more information.

Best regards,
Rickie Oakes"
