"Owen Byrne wrote:&gt; What a load of crap. Politics are somehow more muddy now?  I&#x27;d say that &gt; its considerably &gt; clearer - the vast majority of people feel disenfranchised, and the &gt; common practice of &gt; putting protestors in boxes is done usually to hide them from TV &gt; cameras, visiting dignitaries, &gt; etc, further exacerbating those feelings. &gt; &quot;Unpeaceably disrupting political rallies&quot; is now usually done by police &gt; with riot gear and pepper spray. &gt;  &gt; We had a good one here a month or so ago - a few people peaceably &gt; strayed from the permit area, &gt; which was nearly a mile from the site of the meeting of finance &gt; ministers held here (the motorcade drove &gt; by it for about 10 seconds), and were immediately gassed,  beaten and &gt; arrested. Not very muddied at all. What does that exactly have to do with the statement that distruption of peacable political assembly has become a common practice disruption tool?  It&#x27;s an observation not a judgement, comment, approval.  You&#x27;ve focused on the word &quot;muddy&quot; to use it in a different context than the one I posted.Maybe the distinction I was trying to make was too subtle and I was trying to be too clever with my writing this morning. Let me summarize the important parts of my post for you: I have a premise that there is a difference between free and protected speech and action.  I think O&#x27;Neill on his soapbox doesn&#x27;t understand the distinction.All better?  Greg ",0

"&quot; sycophant &quot; , more . subsequent to my recent posting about the origin of the word &quot; sycophant &quot; i received two comments which add interesting insights . i am forwarding them for your information . richard blucher &gt; from dave wharton ( whartond @ iris . uncg . edu ) liddel &amp; scott &#x27;s _ greek - english lexicon _ shows the word sykophanths in common usage not before the middle of the 5th century b . c . no ancient uses show any relation of the word to the &quot; sign of the fig . &quot; here &#x27;s the political context of its use in the 5th century and later , from the oxford classical dictionary : &quot; athens had no public prosecutors in the modern sense . solon permitted citizens to prosecute any wrongdoers . inducements were offered to volunteers in certain cases by granting them a liberal share of fines and moneys recovered from the treasury . the system worked : there was no lack of prosecutors . but c . 450 b . c . abuses appeared . men began to make a profession of prosecutions for personal , political , and financial reasons . these were called sycophants . in spite of constant references by aristophanes and the orators , there survives no legal definition of a sycophant . . . . the most dangerous type of sycophant was the blackmailer who extorted money so that the guilty escaped punishment and the innocent paid blackmail . . . &quot; * * * * * &gt; from zqv6656 @ acfcluster . nyu . edu a belated comment on your query on &quot; the sign of the fig &quot; . in my homeland , i . e . istria which an adriatic peninsula in the northwestern part of croatia ( former yugoslavia ) we use this sign in two ( related ? ) meanings . the first one is the one mentioned by many other people who responded to you , i . e . the sign of defiance and strong rejection . it does not have any sexual or indecent connotation . its second use is as a good luck sing ( much as crossed fingers in america ) , but then it is done on both hands for either yourself or somebody else ( maybe in defiance to &quot; bad luck &quot; , &quot; devil &quot; , etc . ) zvjezdana vrzic * * * * *",0

But their motives and behavior are &gt; quite different. &gt; &gt; Langur monkeys were the example in the cited &gt; article. &quot;Dominant males .. kill babies that &gt; are not their own.&quot; &quot;The dominant male monkey &gt; .. seeks to defend his harem of females.&quot; But &gt; cozying up to the current dominant male isn&#x27;t &gt; the best strategy for female langurs, because &gt; &quot;dominant males are dethroned by rivals every &gt; 27 months or so.&quot; &quot;By mating with as many &gt; extra-group males as possible, female langurs &gt; ensure their offspring against infanticide,&quot; &gt; by the male who is likely next to rule the &gt; roost. &gt; &gt; Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but that doesn&#x27;t paint a &gt; picture of carefree females engaged in joyously &gt; promiscuous couplings. The dom cab driver who &gt; is taking her two boy toys to New Orleans is a &gt; better picture of that. ;-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________ &gt; Chat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: http://messenger.msn.com &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -- &quot;I don&#x27;t take no stocks in mathematics, anyway&quot; --Huckleberry Finn",0

Indeed, the problem is usually _preventing_ this from happening, as Microsoft Corporation&#x27;s installers seem to forever be overwriting your MBRs when you least wish it, without asking your permission.--  Cheers,               &quot;We&#x27;re sorry; you have reached an imaginary number.

"OFFICE OF:EGNR. FEMI DANIEL FEDERAL MINISTRY OF WORKS AND HOUSING FEDERAL SECRETARIAT OFFICE COMPLEX IKOYI-LAGOS.ATTN:,                  First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of itÂ’s nature as being utterly confidential and top secret as you were introduced to me in confidence through the Nigeria Chamber of Commerce and Industries.We are top officials from the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing,(FMW&amp;H), Federal Ministry of Finance and the Presidency, making up the Contract Review Panel(CRP) set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria to review contracts awarded by the past military administration. In the course of our work on the CRP, we discovered this fund which resulted from grossly over - invoiced contracts which were executed for the FMW&amp;H during the last administration.The companies that executed the contracts have been duly paid and the contracts commissioned leaving the sum of US$21.4 Million floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for payment.I have therefore  been mandated as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US21.4 legally subcontracting the entitlement to your company.This is bearing in mind that our civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign companies or operating foreign accounts while in government service, hence the need for an overseas partner.We have agreed that the funds will be shared thus after it has been paid into your account. (1) 30% of the money will go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the fund. (2) 10% has been set aside as an abstract projection for reimbursement to both parties for incidental expences that may be incurred in the course of the transaction. (3) 60% to us the government officials (with which we intend to commence an importation business in conjunction with you)All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for the smooth conclusion of the transaction within ten to fourteen days of commencement after receipt of the following information; your full names, company&#x27;s name, address,details &amp; activities, telephone &amp; fax numbers.These information will enable us make the applications and lodge claims to the concerned ministries &amp; agencies in favour of your company and it is pertinent to state here that this transaction is entirely based on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque drawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria correspondent bankers around the world is going to be made in your name.Please acknowledge the reciept of this letter using the above e-mail or the Alternative: femi1855@aol.com to reply me. Yours faithfully,Egnr. Femi Daniel.NB:Bank Account Details not necessary as preferred mode of payment is by draft or cheque. --  Irish Linux Users&#x27; Group Social Events: social@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/social for (un)subscription information.

"sum : german / english translation software a little while ago i posted a query about peoples &#x27;s experience with power translator ( professional ) software for german - english translation . here is my colleague &#x27;s summary of responses via this and other lists . 1 . a second hand comment that someone working in art history had found it unsatisfactory 2 . another said that the canadian government uses the power professional ( french ) programme for translation work 3 . another said that the french version gave quite comical or incomprehensible results , but this was on the basic version , not the professional . one conspicuous difficulty was with words which can have the same form as different parts of speech ( eg gerunds ) ; another was variant word order . 4 . someone said ( another second hand comment ) that it was &quot; ok for the first cut &quot; . 5 . a response from the correspondent of an owner of the basic german programme who sent some samples with commentary , showing that as long as you knew both languages and edited the text during translation the results could be satisfactory , but whether the degree of efficiency offsets the time taken to use the programme was not apparent . this correspondent referred to it as a &quot; toy &quot; . 6 . a response from an academic who worked on the ibm translation product who referred to a german computer journal which rated the ibm programme slightly better ( and cheaper ) than the power professional . the reference is _ dos die pc zeitschrift _ 8 &#x27; 95 pp128 - 132 . it is apparent that simple constructions and explicit vocabulary translate more accurately than the complex and allusive , so the satisfaction given will depend very much on the nature of the task and the needs or expectations of the user . for scanning large volumes of print to ascertain the general subject matter these programmes are probably quite satisfactory ; for accurate translations , interactive operation by a translation-competent person would seem to be necessary . i have not yet decided to buy one of these programmes : i await a sales person who is prepared to run the risk of a trial translation on text supplied by me . no satisfied user came forward . andrew carstairs - mccarthy department of linguistics , university of canterbury , private bag 4800 , christchurch , new zealand phone + 64 - 3-364 2211 ; home phone + 64 - 3-355 5108 fax + 64 - 3-364 2065 e-mail a . c-mcc @ ling . canterbury . ac . nz",0

"summary : expletive negation in modern hebrew on february 27 , i posted a querry on expletive negation in modern hebrew . i want to thank ariel cohen ( ariel _ cohen @ riga . mt . cs . cmu . edu ) , michael ephratt ( rhlh702 @ uvm . haifa . ac . il ) , bob fradkin ( raf100f @ oduvm . cc . odu . edu ) , laurence horn ( lhorn @ yalevm . cis . yale . edu ) , paul rowlett ( p . a . rowlett @ mod - lang . salford . ac . uk ) and lucia tovena ( tovena @ latl . unige . ch ) for their comments . my querry originated from michael moore &#x27;s comment to the effect that in modern hebrew , the sentence negation of subordinate clauses dominated by before , until and i &#x27; m afraid can be interpreted referentially or expletively . according to ariel cohen , only until contexts allow an expletive negation . bob fradkin mentionned that expletive negation in mh seemed less frequent than in french . while it seems that expletive negation in mh has a narrower domain of use than in french , there might also be a question of style involved here ; while expletive negation is an aknowledged grammatical feature of formal style in french , it might be a non-standard feature of mh . this is suggested to me by the fact that neither glinert 1989 suggested by michael ephratt nor rosen 1977 even mention expletive negation in mh . lucia tovena pointed me to her 1994 paper in geneva generative papers about italian , hungarian and hindi expletive negation in until contexts . for a typological overview of expletive negation , one can consult horn 1978 , which shows the typological extension of the phenomenon . now , i &#x27; m still left with a few unanswered questions . i &#x27; m surprised that there apparently does n&#x27;t exist any study on the topic in mh . i wonder whether i should be looking in the direction of ancient hebrew . a question of more general interest is how to deal with divergent distributions of a phenomenon across languages ; in other words , how should the fact that expletive negation exists in comparative and fearing contexts in a large number of languages but not in mh ? ? could matters of style , as suggested above , explain this ? ? thanks for those who responded and for those who will . - glinert , l . , 1989 , the grammar of modern hebrew , cambridge up . - horn , l . , 1978 , some aspects of negation , j . greenberg , universals of human language , vol . 4 , standford up , 127-210 . - moore , m . , 1992 , double negation , et cetera , 304-309 . - rosen , 1977 , contemporary hebrew . pierre larrivee departement de langues et linguistique , universite laval , quebec , canada , g1k 7p4 3914larp @ vm1 . ulaval . ca",0

" Related to the MS acquisition of XDegrees?== http://www.internetnews.com/infra/article.php/1466271Sun Nabs Storage Startup By Clint Boulton Amid the flurry of news at its own SunNetwork 2002 conference in San Francisco, Sun Microsystems Thursday said it has agreed to purchase data storage concern Pirus Networks for an undisclosed amount of stock.The Palo Alto, Calif. networking firm bought the Acton, Mass.-based startup with a keen eye for the startup&#x27;s switching (define) devices and virtualization technology. Used as part of a storage area network (define), virtualization is the pooling of storage from many network storage devices into what appears to the operating system to be a single storage device that is managed from a central console.Though major vendors make similar technology, Pirus competes with the likes of Rhapsody Networks and Confluence Networks. Sun plucked Pirus after scouting some 65 companies.Mark Lovington, vice president of marketing for Pirus, told internetnews.com that Pirus and Sun have been in discussion for a while about a possible acquisition. Pirus, he said, succeeded in a goal it shares with a lot of storage startups -- to be acquired by one of the major systems vendors, such as Sun IBM, HP, Hitachi.&quot;This is a huge opportunity for Pirus in a storage market dominated by 6,7 or 8 system-level players,&quot; Lovington said. &quot;Sun sees this acquisition as a critical element to their N1 initiative. The synergies were quite obvious.&quot;N1 is Sun&#x27;s hopeful tour de force in distributed computing (define) architecture, which involves multiple, remote computers that each have a role in a computation problem or information processing. N1 is being styled as the answer for companies looking to manage groups of computers and networks as a single system -- at a lower cost and with greater flexibility.While lagging behind other, more entrenched players, Sun is gaining ground in the storage market with its Sun StorEdge Complete Storage Solutions, according to a new report by IDC. John McArthur, group vice president of IDC&#x27;s Storage program, said Sun Microsystems and IBM posted the largest increases in total storage revenue over Q1 2002, with 32% and 11% gains, respectively. As of Q2, Sun held a 9 percent market share, with revenues of $411 million.Sun&#x27;s acquisition of Pirus is expected to close in the second quarter of Sun&#x27;s 2003 fiscal year, which ends December 29, 2002.",0

"I recently installed Razor v2.14 and started using it.  I am finding it necessary to whitelist a _lot_ of mailing lists.  Some, such as yahoogroups, I can&#x27;t whitelist because the from: address is the person making the post, so I will have to whitelist on another field when I can modify my code to do so.  I wonder if someone is not being careful about their submissions, or if these are bad mailing lists that don&#x27;t drop bad mail addresses that become trollboxes in time.Any employee who has left my company more than three years ago is eligible to become a trollbox.  I figure after three years of bounced mail, the list should have figured out they aren&#x27;t here any more.Fox------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same old cell phone?

I&#x27;m not sure why it is important that the first message in the sequence returned exists, but not necessarily any of the others, but I&#x27;m sure glad it is, as MhSeqExpand gets called lots, and I don&#x27;t know if I could cope if it were checking every file in the sequences it is looking at, all the time...It may help to keep a list of the valid message numbers for the current folder (though that would then need to be verified against changes to the directory).   Does tcl have a directory read function?   I assume so...Mh_Sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the context file) but I&#x27;m not sure how frequently that one is called.  | I&#x27;ll email anything I figure out since I&#x27;m leaving town in less    | than 48 hours.Have a good vacation.kre_______________________________________________ Exmh-workers mailing list Exmh-workers@redhat.com https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers",0

 http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/07/23/binladen.internet/index.html    ... CNN reported earlier this year that al Qaeda has used at least one     Web site to post information and keeps changing the site&#x27;s address to     stay ahead of investigators.    Authorities also are investigating information from detainees that     suggests al Qaeda members -- and possibly even bin Laden -- are hiding     messages inside photographic files on pornographic Web sites.Any wagers that this heralds the appearance of a bill to ban and/or harrass any sites which may be host to suspected-AlQaeda messages?And what about Emenem records played backwards?--  Gary Lawrence Murphy  TeleDynamics Communications Inc Business Innovations Through Open Source Systems: http://www.teledyn.com &quot;Computers are useless.

"I&#x27;m not sure if this is really a razor problem/issue or a sendmail problem. Here&#x27;s the scenario... My mail server is a 150mhz PC funning FreeBSD 4.4. Ordinarily, the machine is quite idle; it supports my wife&#x27;s web site with Apache server running on it and a few other services (jabber, etc). Between the various members of our family, we get a fair amount of email coming in (mailing lists, etc). On occasion, our DSL-based ISP dies for a number of hours. When we get a reconnection to the Internet, I get a huge flow of emails coming in which are then filtered via razor. As a result, I will sometimes see over 20+ sendmail processes running at the same time after such an occasion. The machine is then REALLY slow.I noticed that my /etc/procmailrc file had had no arguments associated with the call to razor-check. There was something in the log, though, to make me suspicious that it was possibly not seeing all my razor files. So I have just added &quot;-home /etc/razor&quot; as an argument. I haven&#x27;t had any down time since then so I cannot comment on whether this change has sped up my razor processing a noticable amount. (This paragraph may be an aside to my real problem, the first paragraph above; but I thought I should be complete in my description.)At any rate, has anyone else suffered from a backlog of email processing creating lots and lots of sendmail processes?  Is there, perhaps, a way to limit the number of sendmail processes?Any ideas would be welcome.Thanks, Joe --- Joe Berry joe@topshot.com AIM &quot;joe topshot&quot; Yahoo Msgr &quot;joetopshot&quot; jabber &quot;joetopshot@topshot.com&quot; Baltimore, MD------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same old cell phone?

"becoming a linguist i support gilbert &#x27;s thesis . to be sure , one stimulus was growing up on a university campus where there were lots of foreign-born faculty , so one heard and saw a lot of different languages in people &#x27;s houses , bookcases , and refrigerators ( like the pickle jar i once saw labelled in polish ) . but another was certainly the movie the day the earth stood still , where michael rennie , playing klaatu , has to communicate with the robot gort in his home language and , indeed , where patricia neal , playing mrs . benson , has to memorize a sentence in that language and repeat it to gort to save the world toward the film &#x27;s end . a third stimulus was majoring in a science in college ( chemistry ) which had a strong focus on concepts of &quot; structure &quot; . finally , one had to actually discover linguistics , which was n&#x27;t the kind of thing one heard about in college before the 60s . it was nice one could do something with language ( s ) without having to be exclusively historically oriented and without having to worry about , say , the kind of apple hurled into the thorax of gregor samsa ( now class , on the basis of textual evidence , was it a golden delicious or not ? or did the apple represent the disapproval of franz the k &#x27;s dad ? ? ? ? ? )",0

"Nick Hilliard&#x27;s [nick-lists@netability.ie] 52 lines of wisdom included: &gt; The standard release versions of ipfilter are unencumbered, as always. &gt;  &gt; &gt; Nope, indeed IPFW2 has just been rolled out into -STABLE. (-STABLE &gt; &gt; is a stable branch of the code that has been rolled into -CURRENT &gt; &gt; first. It&#x27;s basically a major release, that&#x27;s still a work in &gt; &gt; progress) &gt;  &gt; I&#x27;m not so sure that ipfw2 is really ready for production yet, having &gt; only been mfc&#x27;d last wednesday.  It certainly adds some nice syntactic &gt; sugar, and is apparently much faster for certain types of complex &gt; rulesets.  It will be good once it&#x27;s had some time to settle down a &gt; little.I would question anything being ready for &quot;production&quot; being in STABLE.He&#x27;s kept backwards compatibility with ipfw, which is major plus.My point about IPFW2 being rolled out into stable was merely an illustration of the fact that ipfw is indeed not ipfilter, and that there are no license issues there :)--    Philip Reynolds            RFC Networks          tel: 01 8832063 www.rfc-networks.ie      fax: 01 8832041--  Irish Linux Users&#x27; Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

Buying any new machine is going to cause problems with a six month old set of drivers. Same happens in windows - you have to go get your drivers. Yes, dell use the most recent stuff they can, to save money. That&#x27;s not a bad thing.

"language as metaphor &amp; metaphors for language - - session at aaa 98 i have volunteered to organize the following session for the next meeting of the society for linguistic anthropology at aaa 98 ( next winter in washington ) : language as metaphor and metaphors for language metaphor has been shown to be an integral component of the way we conceptualize experience and embody it in language . but metaphor can also be thought of as a specific tool that can be used in a variety of disciplines : a concrete image can summarize or illuminate the object of study , and sometimes even inform the direction of the discipline . new theories give rise to new metaphors , and the study of such metaphors can throw light on the development of theories . papers are invited from both linguists and non-linguists on two topics : 1 ) language used as metaphor : for a restricted communicative code used concurrently with language : e . g . the language of flowers ; but also for various characteristics of expressive or cognitive domains , e . g . the grammar / syntax / vocabulary of architecture , music , etc . ; what characteristics of language are used metaphorically ? to what do they correspond in other domains ? what is the usefulness of language metaphors for the domains in question ? 2 ) language as object of metaphor : what can language be compared to ? explicit ( e . g . neo-grammarian &#x27; family tree &#x27; ; saussure &#x27;s game of chess ; the city ) and implicit ( ? ) metaphors for language ; what do such metaphors reveal about language and how speakers view it ? how do metaphors for language relate to directions in linguistics ? please contact me : marie - lucie tarpent , mount st vincent u , halifax , n . s . b3m 2j6 canada ; 902-457 - 6172 ; marie-lucie . tarpent @ msvu . ca .",0

It is first recorded as being used by Captain  Frederick Marryat in /Jacob Faithful/ in 1835: &quot;I won&#x27;t thrash you Tom.  Shiver my timbers if I do&quot;.It has gained a firm place in the language because almost fifty years  later Robert Louis Stevenson found it to be just the kind of old-salt  saying that fitted the character of Long John Silver in /Treasure  Island/: &quot;Cross me, and you&#x27;ll go where many a good man&#x27;s gone before  you ... some to the yard-arm, shiver my timbers, and some by the board,  and all to feed the fishes&quot;.

"discussion : english only one point that jack aubert made in his recent posting is dead on : quite apart from any putative intention on the part of policy makers , in the u . s . today &quot; bilingualism &quot; rarely means the ability to speak two languages fluently . i &#x27; m thinking particularly about so - - called bilingual classes in our public schools , where many people get their first notion of what this word refers to . i have enrolled my children in these classes whenever possible , but with this decision comes the responsibility to attempt to convince administrators that native speakers of english must be required to learn some spanish in these classes . ( the bilingual classes at my children &#x27;s schools are always spanish - - english . ) it has never been expected in any of the bilingual classes my kids have been in that they should be studying two languages too ! these classes are run as a one-way street - - - and everyone knows it . as one little girl ( required to enroll ) in my daughter &#x27;s class told me , &quot; bilingual means you &#x27; re dumb . &quot; hmmmmmmmmmm what people say the word ` bilingual &#x27; means in your standard want ad is probably too hot an issue to handle . ( is this a new ` ` urban myth &#x27; &#x27; that such ads are actually seeking people of certain ethnicity ? ) i suspect that the term is coming to mean something quite different than its traditional denotation , and sometime soon we &#x27; ll find that the word ` ` bilingual &#x27; &#x27; activates a number of presuppositions about both mastery of english and ethnic identity , not unlike what happened to the term ` ` illegal immigrant &#x27; &#x27; , as was demonstrated in various reports which were released at the time of the debate on prop 187 . this sort of change in the use of the word ` bilingual &#x27; will not help anyone whose goal is to encourage the study and use of more than one language in the u . s . because non - - experts , if they do not control language policy , are certainly involved in that policy making . i suggest that the way to combat it is very local action : take the time to talk to the principal ( s ) of your local public elementary school ( s ) . robin schafer rschafer @ ucsd . edu",0

"die offs in areas with better records parallel and support the claims that European diseases were devastating to all American hemisphere populations, and the reverse was never true. Unlike, for example, India or Asia.There is a hot dispute about the original size of the indigenous population, but the evidence for a high density in the Mexican area is sound. It was up here in the North or in the Amazon where I&#x27;m a little more suspicious of very high upward revisions.At least that was my take.I have never heard anyone seriously argue that European diseases were not a significant factor, or that there were not in fact a lot of Aztec people prior to Cortez. Gee, I&#x27;ve never before heard someone argue unseriously about it either.Do you have a reference for a book or article which does so?&gt; -----Original Message----- &gt; From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of Robert &gt; Harley &gt; Sent: Sunday, August 18, 2002 4:57 PM &gt; To: fork@spamassassin.taint.org &gt; Cc: rah@shipwright.com &gt; Subject: Re: Al&#x27;Qaeda&#x27;s fantasy ideology: Policy Review no. 114 &gt; &gt; &gt;See Jared Diamond&#x27;s excellent &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot; for the story. &gt; &gt; Yeah, I know the party line. The evidence for it is extremely meagre. &gt; New Worlders had two entire continents and tens of millions of people, &gt; which is a plenty big enough reservoir for infectious diseases to thrive &gt; in. Their records show that they were plagued with them long before 1492. &gt; &gt; Take Ireland in the early 1800s. Assume a population of circa 8 &gt; million. Take Ireland around 1900. Assume a population not much &gt; above 3 million. Ignore natural variations between mortality and &gt; natality. Omit emigration. Observe the Great Famine in the middle. &gt; Deduce that it killed 5 million (actually about 1). Transpose to 16th &gt; century Mexico. Grossly inflate estimates of pre-contact population, &gt; because nobody has a damn clue what it was anyway. Underestimate &gt; later population levels. Deduce that 10&#x27;s of millions died.

"When we were discussing Kuhn, I wrote: &gt; My understanding of the history of &gt; plate tectonics is that the magnetic &gt; reversal patterns encoded in seafloor &gt; basalts were crucial supporting data &gt; which suddenly became available only &gt; after Navy declassification, so the &gt; adoption curve may be skewed.Many of the essays in Oreskes&#x27; _Plate Tectonics_ seem to support this idea:Sandwell, &quot;Plate Tectonics: A Martian View&quot; &gt; In this essay, I&#x27;ll describe a few of the important confirmations of &gt; plate tectonic theory provided by satellites and ships.  These tools &gt; were largely developed to support the Cold War effort, and many are &gt; labeled geodetic since they are used to make precise measurements &gt; of the size and shape of the earth and the spatial variations in the &gt; pull of gravity.  The tools of satellite geodesy are needed for all &gt; aspects of global warfare; precise satellite tracking and gravity &gt; field development are needed for precision satellite surveillance &gt; as well as for targeting ballistic missiles; the global positioning &gt; system is used in all aspects of modern warfare; radar altimetery is &gt; used or aiming submarine-launched ballistic missiles as well as for &gt; inertial navigation when submerged. &gt;  &gt; The global seismic networks were developed, primarily, to monitor &gt; underground nuclear tests.  Marine magnetometers were developed, &gt; primarily, for detection of submarines.  Multibeam sea floor mapping &gt; systems were developed, primarily, for surveying critical and &gt; operational areas of the northern oceans.... and the Navy was in no hurry to declassify any of these data, as any uneven coverage could have revealed the parts of the oceans they found most interesting.-Dave(What do our seismic networks say about the middle east?  I hazily recall a story about LA reporters asking their local geophysicists about an early morning quake, to be told that, as far as could be figured, the &quot;epicenter&quot; was at a negative depth, travelling near mach speed, and presumably headed towards Edwards) ",0

"rto orders - grid south , se trans , spp and entergy the southeast rto orders are out and have followed through with what we expected from the discussion at the ferc meeting . the spp and entergy rto proposals have been rejected because they fail to satisfy the scope and configuration requirements of order no . 2000 . the commission notes that the required discussions between spp and entergy and its neighboring rto / tos has led to no increase in the original scope and configuration . the filings by spp and entergy were brief , indicating only a lack of interest by other rtos or utilities in joining to enlarge scope ; they failed to specify any details of the talks , what changes could be made or what could be fixed to accomodate combination with other rtos . the order states that the commission favors the development of large , regional transmission organizations reflecting natural markets . the commission indicates that they favor four rtos - ne , se , mw and west . therefore the order requires the participants in spp and entergy to participate in settlement discussions as set out in the mediation order . note that these meetings will start next tuesday , july 17 before a ferc alj . the southern company rto is also found by the ferc to fail the scope characteristics of order no . 2000 . the order finds that southern &#x27; s approach to focus on mous and seams issues with its neighbors is inadequate . the order states , &quot; we reiterate : the commission &#x27; s goal is to have a single rto in the southeast , and to have that single rto operational as soon as possible . &quot; the commission recognizes that start - up costs in forming a larger rto may be more , but that over the longer term , large rtos will foster market development , will provide increased reliability and will result in lower wholesale electricity prices . the order therefore directs the parties to the mediation as stated above . the grid south participants are also directed to the mediation which is starting on next tuesday . it is a lengthier order with more details on other aspects of rtos , including independent board requirement , congestion managment , interconnection procedures , planning process and cbm . therefore , i am attaching a summary of the order . one of the important findings of the order is that gridsouth is not sufficiently independent ; the applicant tos are making policy decisions that should be made by an independent board . therefore , the order requires gridsouth to install an independent board and file a compliance filing within 90 days . if anyone wants copies of the orders , let me know .",0

My sinus infection, which appeared to be gone, flared up again over  the weekend in the nastiest way, and I am now coughing up dark mucus and doing  other things that probably don&#x27;t bear repeating in a public forum. I have the  10:15 doctor&#x27;s appointment that I should have made last round, had I not  convinced myself that â€œit&#x27;s not that badâ€ and trudged through it  all without prescription drugs. I&#x27;m not making the same mistake this time. I&#x27;ll  be back this afternoon. My email problems of yesterday have been resolved. You can once again reach me  at my normal address, f8dy@diveintomark.org. Kevin Burton[1] emailed me with another way to link to a FOAF file from my RSS  feed. It looks easier than previous suggestions, and it has the advantage of  being able to use it from an RSS 1.0 or 2.0 feed, but I worry about all these  variations. Just as in real life, where people can use different words that  mean essentially the same thing, in the Semantic Web programs can use different  vocabularies to express the same statements. That&#x27;s great for producers, not so  great for consumers who have to make sense of it all. For each domain (RSS feeds, FOAF files, whatever), somebody (or some group)  needs to come along and document best practices. We need better _goal-oriented_  documentation. We have a lot of reference documentation, task-oriented  documentation, but very little that documents that larger picture and answers  questions written in English. â€œHow do I include personal information in  my RSS feed?â€ is a goal-oriented question. â€œCreate a FOAF file  using this tool and then insert this line at this location in your RSS  feedâ€ (with as many examples as necessary) is a goal-oriented answer.  Anything less is like trying to master a foreign language by reading a  dictionary.[1] http://www.peerfear.org/ ",0

It will never come.(Spot the person who applied for the free Solaris 9 DVD, only to be told three months later it is no longer available.)FWIW Solaris and Linux seem to be getting closer all the time.

Since I don&#x27;t quite understand how jpeg works (it&#x27;s hard &gt; math, and I&#x27;m just a dumb comp. eng.)It&#x27;s not hard math - jpeg is a straight block-based DCT with quantisation - which is about the oldest image compression algorithm out there, and I think certainly predates 1986. So I really have no idea what they claim they&#x27;ve patented - doin DCT on 8x8 blocks of an image, quantising the resulting coefficients, or DCT in general? I&#x27;m extremely skeptical about this whole story...&gt; I don&#x27;t know how exactly it &gt; matches up to JPEG. I&#x27;m more curious as to whether it covers MPEG, &gt; because it /is/ described in the context of video streams rather than &gt; stills, and I had a vague impression that the MPEG and JPEG &gt; compression techniques were similar. One of the patents it references &gt; also seems to hint at MPEG.MPEG 1, 2, 4 or 7? They&#x27;re all very different compression algorithms.Anyway, here&#x27;s to ogg, and hopefully the future mpeg4-standard compression algorithm the project comes up with (fingers crossed). And I wouldn&#x27;t worry about the jpeg thing - in addition the patent runs out next year, and I would suggest that having failed to protect their IP for 15 years, as (iirc) is their responsibility, their claim would probably never hold up in court.Cheers, Dave.--         David Neary,     Marseille, France   E-Mail: bolsh@gimp.org--  Irish Linux Users&#x27; Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

Lesson learned?  NO MORE XIMIAN, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.  Man, that was annoying.    Anyway, I have returned to Redhat 7.3 on my root filesystem (saved my home directories, music and games on other partitions) and while I have the 8.0 stuff in the list, everything I want to upgrade requires 200+ RPMs.    I&#x27;m not opposed to this, but apt is.  &quot;apt-get dist-upgrade&quot; dumps core.    What&#x27;s the inside secret here, or do I just start searching mirrors for the ISO and get over it?   ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Brian FahrlÃ¤nder              Linux Zealot, Conservative, and Technomad Evansville, IN                    My Voyage: http://www.CounterMoon.com ICQ  5119262 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Just machines, to make big decisions- programmed by fellas with compassion and vision.

I really like it; it&#x27;s the &gt; &gt;     simple, stable competitor to Windows(tm) that we all need/want/etc. &gt;  &gt; Well, you can already remove me from your &quot;all&quot; statement... :-( I&#x27;ve been &gt; using GNOME 2 at home ever since it made it into Rawhide, and I must say &gt; that I feel really uncomfortable with it : Things are just too limited and &gt; you&#x27;re now asked to stick with the defaults. I&#x27;ve already switched back &gt; from Metacity to Sawfish, but for the main GNOME stuff like the panel and &gt; the control center... there are now too few options for &quot;advanced users&quot; &gt; like me who like to be able to configure as much as possible. &gt;  &gt; Let&#x27;s see how it evolves... but the GNOME guys who decide seem to want to &gt; change everything to be as simple and limited as possible to not confuse &gt; the basic (lower then average IMHO) user. So in the meantime, I stick with &gt; GNOME 1.4 and I&#x27;m quite happy with how it performs in my daily tasks &gt; although it doesn&#x27;t have the nice look of anti-aliased fonts (I mainly use &gt; and LCD screen and projector anyway). &gt;  &gt; &gt;     Problem is, though, Pango (a package that deals with international &gt; &gt;     font rendering) hasn&#x27;t been made available to the apt repository on &gt; &gt;     Sunmore.net. &gt;  &gt; Maybe try grabbing it from the latest Red Hat Linux beta (Limbo) or from &gt; Rawhide... &gt;  &gt; &gt;     Who the heck do I contact for this, anyway? &gt;  &gt; Not me, sorry! &gt;  &gt; Matthias &gt;  &gt; --  &gt; Matthias Saou                                World Trade Center &gt; -------------                                Edificio Norte 4 Planta &gt; System and Network Engineer                  08039 Barcelona, Spain &gt; Electronic Group Interactive                 Phone : +34 936 00 23 23 &gt;  &gt; _______________________________________________ &gt; RPM-List mailing list  &gt; http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list_______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list ",0

"Michael wrote: &gt;  &gt; http://www.post-gazette.com/columnists/20020905brian5.asp I thought this nekkid URL was going to be about the infringement of 1st amendment rights for broadcasters and proposed campaign finanice restrictions preventing them from making money on advertisements that are deemed thinly veiled campaign contributions by some arbitrary government board.  As it was posted to &quot;discussion&quot; I thought there&#x27;d be some.Instead it&#x27;s a Post-Gazette column by Brian O&#x27;Neill lamenting the fact that some people know how to fill out a permit so that they can take advantage of their right to peaceable assembly.  Obviously he&#x27;s poking fun at the idea that specific groups get specific &quot;zones&quot; and that it&#x27;s not up to the police to decide what messages and signs get put into what zones to most expediently keep order.  The problem is that politics have gotten so muddied nowadays, that shouting down and unpeaceably disrupting political rallies that you don&#x27;t agree with has become common practice.  The courts have constantly ruled that there are some restrictions on the first amendment. They teach you that your very first year of law school.I think that given the information as laid out by the story, Mr. O&#x27;Neill has confused free speech with action.  Free speech or even protected speech as practiced by almost  every American seems to involve the ability to communicate an idea to an unknown audience.  Action involves directing a specific comment to a specific well-defined individual or audience that has immediate, harmful, and sometimes physical  effects that is easily forseeable by any reasonable person. I think Bill Neel of Butler needs to go back to school as obviously he must have been sleeping in his civics class or else they didn&#x27;t teach civics in mini-guantanamo, OH 65 years ago.Greg ",0

"On Sat, 2002-08-24 at 08:04, Gregory Alan Bolcer wrote: &gt; There&#x27;s been well documented articles, studies of the &gt; French tax laws, corporate governance, and financial &gt; oversight that 1) dont&#x27; easily allow for ISOs, the root &gt; of almost all entrepreneurialship, and 2) the easy flow &gt; of capital to new ventures.  It was an extremely large &gt; issue, even debated widely in France. It is actually a lot worse than this.  What it boils down to is that only the privileged class is really allowed to start a serious company.  What I found fascinating is that the old French aristocracy effectively still exists (literally the same families), but they now hold top executive and management positions in the major French firms and the government, positions which are only passed on to other blue bloods. Not officially of course, but as a strict matter of practice.  And the laws and legal structures make sure that this system stays firmly in place.  Even for a young French blue blood, strict age hierarchies keep them from branching out into a new venture in their own country (though many can leverage this to start companies in OTHER countries).  I know about the French system first-hand and the executives are quite candid about it (at least to Yanks like me who are working with them), but I suspect this may hold true for other European countries as well.  After all those &quot;revolutions&quot;, France is still nothing more than a thinly veiled old-school aristocracy, with all the trappings.-James Rogers  jamesr@best.com",0

"There is a whitelist RBL now!  Ironport&#x27;s Bonded Sender is  basically a whitelist RBL where you post a bond to get on the  list, and then lose the bond if you end up spamming from that IP  address (or something like that).  http://www.bondedsender.org/COn Sunday, August 25, 2002, at 07:58  PM, Bart Schaefer wrote:&gt;&gt; 4. DNSBL: Only certifies an ip address, not who is using it. As it is &gt;&gt; currently used, DNSBL allows you to look up if some IP address  &gt;&gt; has been &gt;&gt; blacklisted by someone. What I haven&#x27;t seen is a service that  &gt;&gt; provides a &gt;&gt; DNS based whitelist. &gt; &gt; There&#x27;s a practical reason for that:  Any DNS list (white or  &gt; black) works &gt; only for a limited number of IPs; the set of unlisted IPs is  &gt; much larger &gt; than the set in the DNS list.  If you have to make a binary decision to &gt; accept or reject, you&#x27;ll be wrong less often if you reject the  &gt; blacklist &gt; and accept everything else, rather than accept the whitelist and reject &gt; everything else. &gt; &gt; A whitelist is only helpful when (a) you only want mail from a limited &gt; number of known sources, or (b) you can use a secondary system  &gt; like SA to &gt; decide what to do with the vast unlisted masses.  Most MTAs still make &gt; only the binary decision, because the secondary computation is  &gt; expensive. &gt; &gt; With SA&#x27;s cooperation, though, it might be worth a try.

The  &gt; jury is still out, but so far only a few brief rebellions and  &gt; referendums and such, still together after 130+ years. Alberta, and to a lesser extent some of the other Western provinces, is definitely not happy with the current arrangement.  Some of this has to do with the strange way the Canadian government is structured.  When I was last up in Alberta (a month ago), the newspapers were reporting something like 70% of Albertans favor separating from Canada, and over several distinct issues.The problem is basically that while Alberta is an economic powerhouse that is propping up the weaker economies of the Eastern provinces, their interests are openly and unapologetically ignored by the government in Ottawa.  While Alberta sends something like twice the tax dollars to Ottawa per capita of the average Canadian, they only have token representation in the federal government.  While I&#x27;m not clear on exactly how the government works up there, representation is not entirely based on population, and it works out that some eastern provinces with populations smaller than the city of Calgary alone have substantially more representatives in the legislature than the entire province of Alberta.  The long and the short of it is that the eastern provinces use Alberta as a personal ATM machine for their social programs while not even so much as throwing Alberta a bone, and are able to do so because even the sparsely populated eastern provinces can out-vote Alberta despite having fewer people.  Or something like that.  The Canadian government is less restricted than the US government, so they can do strange things, like having restrictive regulations that only apply to certain provinces, Alberta being on the receiving end of many such obscenities.  It is essentially a much worse version of what is happening in the inter-mountain West of the US.  Unlike the US case though, the rest of Canada would really be hurting if they weren&#x27;t receiving all those tax dollars from Alberta.  OTOH, Alberta would probably thrive.I have friends in Alberta, and visit occasionally, but I&#x27;m not totally clear on everything that goes on in that country, due to my partial unfamiliarity with how the government works up there, so I&#x27;m a little fuzzy on some of the details.  What I do know is that on average the Albertans are quite unhappy with their current position in Canada and the sentiment has been getting worse over the years.Cheers,-James Rogers  jamesr@best.com",0

I&#x27;ve always been under the impression that the uncontrollable forest fires were the result of the Forest Service&#x27;s long-standing &quot;10:00 A.M. policy&quot;, in place until the decision in 1963 to switch over to &quot;let-it-burn&quot;.The 10:00 A.M. policy was based on theories about forest management from Europe, and wasn&#x27;t as applicable to the American wilds. So, we went from a policy of containment for 100 years to one of letting things burn unless they directly threatened property.40 years after the end of the containment policy there is still a lot of stuff left to burn. I can&#x27;t imagine that artificially planted replacement forests, with dense stands of identical trees, help that much either. I would be comfortable laying the fault for these contributing factors squarely with the Forest Service. I would put the blame for many burned homes upon the people who chose to build their dwelling with an unwise combination of materials, location, and landscaping.--  njl http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork ",0

"Martin: &gt; Yes, confirming what I said in my last message. Ah! I see where the problem &gt; lies! You seem to be labouring under the misapprehension that Zimbabwe and &gt; Zambia are the same country. &gt; No, that would be rather silly. There are conflicting reports on whether Zambia is prepared to accept milled GM grain or not - and, from reports from various sources, considerable debate within that country. There&#x27;s complex issues, not all of which can be dismissed by blaming those nasty environmentalists, which was my original point.TimC------------------------ Yahoo!

You have the choice to ignore it That&#x27;s not what the First Amendment says at all. It says that Congress cannot  say what can&#x27;t be FoRKed. FoRK can establish any rules it wants. Similarly,  The New York Times gets to choose what news IT thinks is &quot;fit to print.&quot; If  the Times chose not to print anything about, say, Rosie O&#x27;Donnell, it would  be exercising its First Amendment rights, just as much as it would be if it  chose to print something Rosie O&#x27;Donnell doesn&#x27;t like. The necessary  corollary of the freedom to say/publish what one wants is the freedom to  refuse to publish or say what one doesn&#x27;t like. The alternative is a  state-controlled press that reprints government press releases and calls them  news.The question of what is or is not FoRKed is (except for libel or other  specific exceptions) not a matter of law, but a matter of what the  &quot;publisher&quot; (if any) decides or the &quot;community&quot; (if any) negotiates or does  as a matter of custom.For my part, I&#x27;d rather people didn&#x27;t use FoRK as a place in which to dump an  expression of their political beliefs.Tom ",0

Or do they posit a pre-Mosaic form of the laws that had evolved by time of the Pentateuch?&gt; In particular, there was a claim that the commandment on stealing was &gt; actually specifically about &#x27;man stealing -- selling a free man into &gt; slavery.This seems bogus to me. A quick check of the text indicates the the Hebrew word in question is GANAV which elsewhere in the Pentateuch (eg Gen 44.8) is used to mean steal silver and gold amongst other things.In July 1999, I made the following comment in response to a similar claim about the &quot;real&quot; meaning of one of the ten commandments:&quot;&quot;&quot; &gt; The translations since cause problems at each successive removeWe have the original language versions, though, so this is not an issue.&gt; I&#x27;m sure most everyone is familiar with the argument that the meaning of the commandment &gt; is &#x27;thou shalt not murder&#x27; rather than &#x27;kill,&#x27;This has nothing to do with successive translations. It is based on our knowledge of the meaning of the Hebrew word &quot;ratsach&quot;. Most modern translations I&#x27;ve seen translate it &quot;murder&quot; but elsewhere the word is used of an animal killing a human (something for which most English speakers wouldn&#x27;t use the word &quot;murder&quot;). &quot;&quot;&quot; - http://www.xent.com/FoRK-archive/july99/0163.htmlJames --    James Tauber   jtauber@jtauber.com http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",0

"summary : german terms for sibilant , shibilant , etc . just the other day i asked if anybody knew the german terms for sibilant , shibilant , and the category of sound which russian , georgian , etc . linguists know as , in effect , &#x27;s ibilant-shibilant &#x27; ( of which the polish s-acute , c-acute , and z-acute , orthographically speaking , are examples ) . peter daniels noted that older german works on semitology do not use any special terms . carsten breul reported sibilant and schibilant , and also , for the former , zischlaut ( one wishes it were * zisslaut , but languages are only human ! ) . a source off linguist tells me that a shibilant is also a rauschlaut , although carsten tells me this does not appear to be a widespread usage ( but thinks it sounds very suitable ) . so , zischlaut and rauschlaut it is . but i guess there is still the problem of the remaining category ( which has names in russian and georgian , but not to my knowledge in english , french , or german ) . maybe we should collectively try to come up with something for each of these languages ? alexis manaster ramer",0

"Here&#x27;s a weird and wacky problem:I&#x27;m currently out of the country with my trusty Evo N600c laptop. When I  tried to use the serial port to talk to my mobile phone, Linux behaved  pretty much as if the port was fried. Bizarre, I thought, because I&#x27;d  used it successfully while in the office. The only difference was that I  was trying the thing in the hotel. I entertained brief notions of having  somehow fried the serial drivers, then rebooted the laptop to Windows  and tried again. Worked perfectly. Back to Linux. Still not talking.  Considered that it might be flaky power, so I ran the laptop on battery.  Nope. Tried moving the laptop to a differnet part of the room where  there might be less bogon flux. Still not working. Eventually I gave up  and used the IrDA port instead - which is usually the serial connection  of doom, grief, and teeth-grinding.This morning, in the office, the damn thing is working without a hitch.Anyone like to suggest what mystery technology is in use in the hotel  that prevents serial ports from working under Linux?Cheers, Waider. --  waider@waider.ie / Yes, it /is/ very personal of me--  Irish Linux Users&#x27; Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

"On Tue, Aug 27, 2002 at 11:38:00PM +0100, Vincent Cunniffe mentioned: &gt; There is absolutely no way to use a conventional 3.5&quot; drive with a &gt; laptop directly. However, you can get an external firewire or USB &gt; cradle and attach it to the laptop like that, and any 3.5&quot; drive &gt; will work in that case. Ah, they told me that about my A1200. Just got a video box, cut air holes and a hole for the cables, then got an extra-long 2.5&quot; to 3.5&quot; IDE cable, and connected it up. Had to make a few holes in the A1200 case for the IDE cable too. Worked a charm.

"I&#x27;m sure that The Beatles are weel happy with Microserfs for robbing them blind of their &quot;intellectual Property&quot;I&#x27;m gonna mail complaints@microsoft.com and get them to put an end to these windows cd&#x27;s ;--)Don&#x27;t suppose you have a reference for it? I&#x27;ve made a lot of friends in the MS complaints department, its amazing what you can say to them and get away with it --::)))CWAnd no sorry I don&#x27;t know the solution, they must be pretty bad quality though if you can fit 25 albums on one CD. I would say they are Mpeg encoded or some buzz like that. --------------------- I&#x27;ve got some really interesting wav files here.A friend had a Windows CD with, wait for it . . .Every Beatles Record ever released in the U.K.! Including the Christmas and  BBC special albums! All on one, ordinary CD! Yes a 650M CD!Of course this CD also had a special Windows app for playing this collection!I had a look at the contents of the CD, since I don&#x27;t do Windows, and the  albums appeared to be plain wav files? Each album in it&#x27;s own wav file, 25  Albums, 25 wav files?!? I copied the wav files to my hard drive. Curious thing, though, noatun crashes on some of the larger ones, seems to  attempt to load the entire file into memory first, and on the ones it doesn&#x27;t  crash on, it plays them fast and noisily? kwave refuses to recognise them  completely and wavp just makes an ungodly noise!xanim can, and does play them correctly though. Unfortunately xanim does nothave any position control so you just have to listen to the album from startto finish.file has this to say about them:johngay@debian:/home/jgay$ file beatles/SGT.WAV beatles/SGT.WAV: RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio, Microsoft ADPCM,  stereo 22050 Hz johngay@debian:/home/jgay$ ls -l beatles/SGT.WAV -r-xr-xr-x    1 johngay  johngay  53334900 Sep 27  2001 beatles/SGT.WAVAnd this is SGT Pepper&#x27;s lonely Hearts Club Band album. 51M is quite good,  considering it also has the inner track. But they certainly are NOT in stereo.What I would like to do is split up the tracks and convert them the mp3 for  xmms. I&#x27;m jsut not sure what tools would be able to handle these strange  compressed wav&#x27;s that only xanim seems to recognise? I like the albums, but  would prefer to be able to sellect tracks to play rather than entire albums  and be able to listen to all my music with one app. I know xmms has a WAV  plugin, but it does not recognise these either.Any help will be greatly appreciated!Cheers, John Gay --  Irish Linux Users&#x27; Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

"URL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20020913.html Date: Not suppliedJohn Robb has an interesting perspective on trust-based, targetted advertising [1] based on his experiences at Gomez during the heady days of the Internet  gold rush. Nobody believes advertisements[2] any more. There&#x27;s a lot of evidence that  advertising just doesn&#x27;t work, no matter how targetted, so if you have a  product to sell you have no choice but to get into the editorial side, where  consumers&#x27; defenses are lowered. Product placements are one example of this. There is an unfortunate tragedy of the commons, here. When advertising first  rose to prominence, advertisements _did_ work. We hadn&#x27;t built up our  immunities yet. As more and more advertisers used the opportunity of the medium  to lie, we learned not to trust advertisements. But we still trust editorial.  And once editorial gets polluted by desperate marketers using PR instead  of advertising to promote their message, nobody will believe it either.[1] http://jrobb.userland.com/stories/2002/09/11/trustbasedAdvertising.html [2] http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060081988/ref=nosim/joelonsoftware ",0

"I don&#x27;t know who said the below.1) Measured in money, you are wrong.  Different ethnic groups achieve at widely different rates.  Always have.  A lot of research has been done on that topic, Sowell among others.2) If you exchanged the population of India and America, in a generation India would look like America.  In Two, America would look like India.3) As Bob said: &#x27;valuable resources&#x27; has notin&#x27; to do with it.  See Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, ... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;m sure that if someone checked the statistics, that the number of &gt; &gt; &quot;successful&quot; vs. &quot;unsuccessful&quot; (how to define those?) Indian &gt; &gt; immigrants in the US is statistically similar to the number of &gt; &gt; successful vs. unsuccessful Scotsmen.  I&#x27;m not going to, though. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; India is poor because it always was poor.  Unlike other countries &gt; &gt; in the region (including Ghana, Nigeria, et al) that have emerged &gt; &gt; from the ashes of Imperialism with strong growth, India is not &gt; &gt; blessed with a strong base of valuable resources. &gt; http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",0

"&gt;See Jared Diamond&#x27;s excellent &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot; for the story.Yeah, I know the party line.  The evidence for it is extremely meagre. New Worlders had two entire continents and tens of millions of people, which is a plenty big enough reservoir for infectious diseases to thrive in.  Their records show that they were plagued with them long before 1492.Take Ireland in the early 1800s.  Assume a population of circa 8 million.  Take Ireland around 1900.  Assume a population not much above 3 million.  Ignore natural variations between mortality and natality.  Omit emigration.  Observe the Great Famine in the middle. Deduce that it killed 5 million (actually about 1).  Transpose to 16th century Mexico.  Grossly inflate estimates of pre-contact population, because nobody has a damn clue what it was anyway.  Underestimate later population levels.  Deduce that 10&#x27;s of millions died.  Lather, rinse, repeat.R http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",0

"linguistics in science fiction content - length : 3073 the postings on linguistics in science fiction for the past couple of months have been interesting , but curiously limited to comparing two types or genres of writing as if all that is going on with linguistics in science fiction these days is that some writers who are sf novelists have been injecting a few &#x27; neat linguistic ideas &#x27; into their narratives and some ( distinctly other ) group of writers who are linguists read these stories for fun and like to point out the borrowed ideas to other linguists . thats not all that &#x27;s happening these days folks . it seems to me that some of the most interesting things going on with linguistics in science fiction is in the blurring of these and other genres ( a general phenomena that george steiner argued was well underway 20 years ago in his _ after babel _ ) . it does n&#x27;t take much digging through my library to come up with some examples of writers who &#x27; ply the frames &#x27; of sf in ways that deserve to be read by linguists &#x27; for serious &#x27; . samuel r . delany &#x27;s novels have been mentioned on the list , but he has also published two volumes of linguistic essays , _ the jewel - hinged jaw : notes on the language of science fiction _ 1977 . new york : dragon press . and _ starboard wine : more notes on the language of science fiction _ 1984 . new york : dragon press . richard rorty , probably known by many linguists interested in the philosophy of language ( from his writing on the &#x27; linguistic turn &#x27; in that field ) , tells a science fiction story about a mid-twenty - first century expedition to antipodea , a planet where the natives lack the concept of mind as part of his argument about &#x27; persons without minds &#x27; in _ philosophy and the mirror of nature _ 1980 . suzette haden elgin is a third writer ( and a linguist ) who writes about science fiction &#x27; for serious &#x27; . one medium in which she does this is the linguistics &amp; science fiction network , which publishes a newsletter ( $ 10 annual membership fee ) out of the ozark center for language studies ( p . o . box 1137 , huntsville , ar 72740 e - mail : ocls @ sibylline . com . ) . i &#x27; m sure that there are other such &#x27; blurred genre &#x27; pieces at the interface between science fiction and linguistic theory . i &#x27;d encourage other subscribers to describe them here in addition to the usual novels and short stories ( the serious stuff can be read &#x27; just for fun &#x27; too . . . ) . paul gracie",0

"logic and natural language semantics esslli-99 workshop : foundations of intensional logic and natural language semantics call for papers the main focus of the european summer schools in logic , language and information is the interface between linguistics , logic and computation . it is organized under the auspices of the european association for logic , language and information ( folli ) . foundational , introductory and advanced courses together with workshops cover a wide variety of topics within six areas of interest : logic , computation , language , logic and computation , computation and language , language and logic . previous summer schools have been highly successful , attracting around 500 students from europe and elsewhere . the school has developed into an important meeting place and forum for discussion for students and researchers interested in the interdisciplinary study of logic , language and information . esslli-99 will take place at the university of utrecht , the netherlands , august 9-20 . in its first week it will feature a worskshop on foundations of intensional logic and natural language semantics . its aim is to provide a forum for advanced ph . d . students and other researchers to present and discuss their work on the following issues . intensional logic lies at the heart of a montague - style natural language semantics . it involves a representation of properties , relations and propositions ( prps ) . in traditional montague grammar , prps are characterized in terms of possible worlds , and the logico-semantic paradoxes are avoided by using a russellian hierarchy of types . the problems with this traditional approach ( e . g . , logical omniscience and expressive limitations ) have led to the flourishing of more fine - grained notions of prp , and to type-free solutions to the paradoxes ( gupta and belnap , barwise and etchemendy , cocchiarella , bealer , asher and kamp , chierchia and turner , etc . ) . the new approaches have problems of their own and no new framework has become standard . this workshop thus will explore and compare well - known or newly proposed foundational approaches for an intensional logic that can serve the purposes of natural language semantics . if you are interested in presenting your research , please send a two page abstract to : francesco orilia orilia @ unimc . it dipartimento di filosofia e scienze umane ph . + 39 ( 0733 ) 258 305 universit = e0 di macerata fax + 39 ( 0733 ) 235 339 62100 macerata italy the submission deadline is : march 15 , 1999 . workshop speakers will pay a reduced essli-99 registration fee , which will entitle them to attend all other courses and workshops . it may be possible to allocate a sum of about 100 ecu to partially cover the expenses of each workshop speaker . there will soon be an esslli &#x27; 99 web page at : http : / / esslli . let . uu . nl / .",0

"syntax / philosophy of lang cormack , annabel ; definitions : implications for syntax , semantics , and the language of thought ; 0-8153 - 3131 - 2 , cloth ; pages , $ 83 ; garland publishing ; outstanding dissertations in linguistics the answer to the question &quot; how can we understand and use a definition ? &quot; provides new constraints on natural language and on the internal language in which meaning is mentally represented . most syntax takes the sentence as the basic unit for well-formedness , but definitions force us to focus on words and phrases , and hence to focus on compositional syntax in parallel with compositional semantics . this study examines both dictionary definitions and definitions from textbooks from the points of view of their syntax , semantics , and use for learning word meaning . the tools used throughout are principles and parameters syntax , relevance theoretic pragmatics , model theoretic semantics , and the formal theory of definitions . the analyses argue that because phrases can be understood in isolation , some standard syntactic analyses must be modified . &#x27; np movement &#x27; has to be reanalysed as transmission of theta roles . these ideas are then applied to a variety of adjectives which take propositional complements . the final chapter argues that for definitions to be understood , the syntax of the language of thought must be close to that of natural language in specifiable ways . for example , semantic types must be common to the two languages . the book will be of interest to linguists concerned with syntax , semantics and pragmatics ; philosophers of mind and of language ; and lexicographers . e - mail : info @ garland . com",0

If they do, the decision could be a turning point  in redefining a balance between copyright consumers and producers ï¿½ and the  technology companies that are often in the middle.&quot; Newsweek: Glitterati vs. Geeks[3]. &quot;Larry Lessig admits it: heï¿½s nervous.

But itï¿½s actually a high-noon showdown between two great industries at odds in  the age of the Internet.&quot; &#x27;Thereï¿½s a sense of deja vu to this. Television was  supposed to be the death of movies. And in 1982, the film industryï¿½s  silver-tongued lobbyist Jack Valenti testified that ï¿½the VCR is to the American  film producer and the American public as the Boston strangler is to the woman  home alone.ï¿½ (Video sales are now the studiosï¿½ biggest moneymaker.) Naturally,  Hollywood regards the computer/Internet combo as scarier than ï¿½Nightmare on Elm  Street.ï¿½&#x27;[1] http://www.marketplace.org/ [2] http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/07/business/media/07ARGU.html [3] http://www.msnbc.com/news/817175.asp ",0

"accuracy of historical reconstruction in writing in linguist 5 . 1393 on another topic , martinha @ fub46 . zedat . fu-berlin . de ( martin haspelmath ) says : ) it is true that latin syntax could hardly be reconstructed from ) modern romance languages , but neither could latin morphology , and ) even the view of latin phonology that we would get from romance is ) very distorted . our reconstruction of protolanguage grammar is ) always imperfect . . . in looking at historical reconstruction done for s . american languages ( largely phonological ) , i &#x27; ve often wondered about this . just how much could we trust the reconstructions that we did ? one of my rules of thumb for those languages was that if an item was longer than one syllable , it was suspect as being polymorphemic , and if it was longer than two syllables it was almost certainly polymorphemic . the problem is that most attempts at reconstruction ignored this areal phenomenon ( sometimes because the data was simply unavailable ) . from what i know of romance languages , i would say polysyllabic morphemes are more common there . if anything , that should make it easier to reconstruct latin , since you have more to work with . ( of course , the morphology of romance languages is much better known than that of the languages of s . america , which also helps ! ) so if latin would be very imperfectly reconstructed , what hope is there for native american languages ? has anyone ever attempted , as an exercise in the comparative method , reconstruction of latin from the romance languages , then compared the results with the real thing ? or reconstruction of any other attested language from its descendents ?",0

"&gt;Sorry for the OT. Just wondering if anybody knows of a similar type mailing &gt;list specifically dealing with MacOSX?  (which, FYI is a version of BSD)&gt;SlÃ¡n,&gt;TimHi Tim, It isn&#x27;t a &quot;version&quot; of anything except NeXTSTEP, with a Mac hackjob. It has a bastardised, but functional BSD -layer- which sit&#x27;s atop Mach and uses case insensitive HFS+ but it isn&#x27;t really a BSD.(Here&#x27;s a neat trick, touch &quot;Makefile&quot; and &quot;makefile&quot;, notice the lack of error message but the absence of &quot;makefile&quot;, and don&#x27;t bother formatting for UFS. The Apple UFS implementation performs like a dog, was frozen in 97, implemented badly and has not been updated since. HFS+ get&#x27;s tweaked every now and then, but enough screaming has them looking at shoving UFS2 in there somewhere down the road. )Then there&#x27;s the holdover NeXT inherent weirdness, such as multiple versions of common Unix files, but none of them do anything, and all changes you would usually append to them have to go through NetInfo Manager.All in all, I find it to be a functional, if not overly quirky desktop environment.As for your initial question, http://www.omnigroup.com/developer/mailinglists/Regards, Mark. --  Irish Linux Users&#x27; Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

Book &gt; &gt; early, avoid the rush. &gt;  &gt; Hey, meybee by then, Bush&#x27;s grand plan for a missle defense system will &gt; actually pan out and -work- ... &gt; I&#x27;m not holding my breath, but i&#x27;m not going to panic for something thats &gt; a little under 17 years away, either. I don&#x27;t think a ballistic missile defense system will be much help against a rock a couple thousand kilometers in diameter.  That&#x27;s WAY outside the design spec for any such system.  Particularly when ballistic intercept designs usually don&#x27;t have any type of warhead associated with them, either being kinetic or directed energy weapons.Contrary to popular belief, ballistic missile defense isn&#x27;t a hard problem (ignoring whether or not it is useful).  The only real challenge is materials science, as it really pushes the envelope of materials performance requirements to places they&#x27;ve never been; there has been some technology crossover with some of the new materials and processes they&#x27;ve had to come up with.  The actual discrimination algorithms, while way more advanced than anything you&#x27;ll see in the private sector (and classified, to keep it that way), are usually run on a crusty old MIPS R3k embedded processor or similar, with a low-to-mid range DSP to help out. It is not computationally intensive by any means.I used to be tangentially involved in various ballistic missile intercept weapon programs many years ago and am pretty familiar with the technologies that go into them.  Most of the arguments against it from a technological standpoint are ignorant bullshit, and have lead me to believe that hardly anyone understands the technical parameters of ballistic missile intercept.  And the arguments that are made without reference to the capability of the technology are neither particularly convincing nor conclusive.In summary:1) Ballistic missile intercept technology is useless on a big rock.  You are much better off using heavy-lift space technology to deliver a big nuke (or small nuke, depending on your plan). 2) State-of-the-art ballistic missile intercept technology is far more competent than most people imagine it is, and has discrimination capabilities that exceed most popular belief.  It better be -- they&#x27;ve had twenty years to work on it.3) I&#x27;ve never heard a really convincing argument against deploying ballistic missile intercept technology, particularly considering most of the R&amp;D investment has already been made. I don&#x27;t really care about it one way or the other, but I also don&#x27;t see why other people have fits over it either.Cheers,-James Rogers  jamesr@best.com http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork ",0

"I have a situation with a small network as follows:A number of client workstations which are running VMware, each of which will run a local copy of Samba (not the VMware autoinstalled version) to let VMware access local linux disks.An NIS/NFS server which will also run Samba to allow the VMware clients access to its filesystems.How can I set things up so that all the VMware clients (all running &#x27;doze 98, possibly being upgraded in future to W2K) authenticate against the NIS server&#x27;s Samba ? I have read the Samab documentation in  large quantities down through the years but as I&#x27;ve never wanted to do anything like this, I never paid much attention to all the stuff about domain controllers etc. which I presume is what I will need to have running here.I would also like, if at all possible, to have synchronisation of passwords between the NIS domain and the NIS server&#x27;s Samba with minimal manual intervention.Ideas, accompanied by annotated Samba configration files :-) , gratefully received.

"i will be out next week imbalances : i would like us to continue to pursue channel / el paso / tenngasco for our payback . they got our cashout number last week , where do they stand . again , i think robert is an ally and i do not want to irritate him but things will not get any better in the future . we need to resolve this imbalance . can we net some of these contracts ? i like mary poorman &#x27; s report ; however i have questions : how can we miss black marlin so completely ? do we agree with this imbalance ? can we net all the chevron and dynegi contracts together for payback to keith once we get the ar issue solved ? where do we stand on the columbia energy resolution ? where do we stand on the ngpl reconcilliation ? duke energy 206 is still a problem . do we need all these amoco contracts they have 8 , that seems like a large number to me , can we net some of them ? are we charging enough for the swing we get at the paper plant on the entex contract ? is there a way to keep tejas in line at southern union this winter ? that meter will really swing then and i do not know how much line pack they have the right to use . can we net the corpus christi gas marketing and all the tejas / coral / gulf energy / shell imbalances down ? how is the reconcillitation going ? can we smash the entex and the reliant contracts together so we can get rid of some of these contracts ? they have 9 , that seems like a lot to me . gulfmark is gone down the road can we check with someone about this contract , it seems like we should be able to net these volumes against some where we are owed ? is this lone star 213 imbalance real , if so how do we resolve ? where did the exxon imbalance come from ? do we need 5 texaco transportation contracts , can we get rid of some ? can we combine the vastar and the southern imbalances ? what is the webb / duval do , can we get rid of it , combine this with midcon , how old is this imbalnce ? mick update the compressor fuel on the p / l but the new numbers do not seem to translate up to the profit calculation ? can we do something about this ? i thought the imbalance report i got this wed was pretty sad . some of the columns did not add and there seemed to be a lot of missing information . can we resolve this ? i am concerned about our capacity positons in the future , we are going to have to work on a better way to check our positions . i had a meeting with tom shelton and our representative to the rrc , james mann , the rrc is concerned about this winter and they have asked us to compile a list of customers we will cut based upon the priority we filed with the rrc several years ago . lauri will have a copy of the priority list . we need to compile this list and get tom and james comfortable with the process . the last thing we need is the rrc hammering on us , when can we get this list ? i think we should be able to get something out of the contract system . jackie morgan is who i would approach .",0

"URL: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/09/24.html#light_reading Date: 2002-09-24T10:46:15-05:00- _Phil Ringnalda_: Putting on the brakes[1]. â€œSo, the answer to the  question that started this whole project, &quot;what is the RDF in RSS 1.0 good  for?&quot; is two things: it&#x27;s good for someone who has an infinitely large database  that can be queried infinitely fast by a schema-aware program, or it&#x27;s good for  writing a schema-aware aggregator that can try to figure out what it should do  with new elements that it hasn&#x27;t seen before. That&#x27;s actually an interesting  project with some potential for success, but at this point I&#x27;m sick of the  whole thing, so I&#x27;ll leave that project for someone else.â€  - _Aaron Swartz_: TRAMP: Makes RDF look like Python data structures[2].  â€œRDF/XML got you down? Tired of having to go through contortions to deal  with data? Want to write Python and be standards-compatible at the same time?  Need a module to implement the psuedo-code you had on your slides? TRAMP may or  may not be the answer to these problems!â€ Complete with an example of  parsing FOAF files.  - _Dan Connolly_: HyperRDF: Using XHTML Authoring Tools with XSLT to produce  RDF schemas[3]. â€œXML syntax is a little tedious, but lots of people are  evidently willing and able of editing it by hand. RDF adds another layer of  tedium, but there are still a few folks willing to write it by hand. I make  heavy use of reification/quoting in my representation of logical formulas in  RDF. This adds another layer of tedium that I find unmanageable, and I have  been writing XML/SGML/HTML by hand for 10 years.â€ Also includes a cogent  explanation of the obscure profile attribute in HTML.

"http://www.abc.net.au/news/justin/weekly/newsnat-26jul2002-53.htmPlayStation owners win copyright caseOwners of PlayStation consoles who modify their machines to play games bought overseas have had a win in the Federal Court.Sony Computer Entertainment has failed in its claim that &quot;chipping&quot; breaks copyright laws.Sony launched legal proceedings against a Sydney man, Eddy Stevens, for allegedly selling pirated games and also providing and installing modification chips.PlayStation consoles in Australia are different from those in the US and Japan because of the different television formats.The court was told &quot;chipping&quot; allows people to play legitimately bought overseas games and copies of games, but also pirated games.The judgement by Federal Court Justice Ronald Sackville says Sony failed to prove that PlayStation consoles have a copyright protection measure installed in the first place and therefore could not rule that a mod chip breaks copyright legislation.Mr Stevens was found to have infringed trademark rules in relation to the pirated games he sold a matter which will come before the court again next month.http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork ",0

" In a message dated 9/24/2002 11:24:58 AM, jamesr@best.com writes:&gt;This situation wouldn&#x27;t have happened in the first place if California &gt;didn&#x27;t have economically insane regulations.  They created a regulatory &gt;climate that facilitated this.  So yes, it is the product of &gt;over-regulation. &gt;Which is to say, if you reduce the argument to absurdity, that law causes  crime. (Yes, I agree that badly written law can make life so frustrating that people  have little choice but to subvery it if they want to get anything done. This  is also true of corporate policies, and all other attempts to regulate  conduct by rules. Rules just don&#x27;t work well when situations are fluid or  ambiguous. But I don&#x27;t think that the misbehavior of energy companies in  California can properly be called well-intentioned lawbreaking by parties who  were trying to do the right thing but could do so only by falling afoul of  some technicality.)If you want to get to root causes, we should probably go to the slaying of  Abel by Cain. Perhaps we can figure out what went wrong then, and roll our  learning forward through history and create a FoRKtopia.Nonpartisanly, which is to say casting stones on all houses, whether  bicameral or unicameral, built on sand or on rock, to the left of them or to  the right of them, of glass or brick or twig or straw, Tom ",0

"Severity: Security Product: libpng Keywords: Red Carpet libpng buffer overflow URL: http://support.ximian.com/q?283 References:  Release Notes for libpng  ftp://swrinde.nde.swri.edu/pub/png-group/archives/png-list.200207libpng is a library used to create and manipulate PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image files.The 1.2.4* and 1.0.14 releases of libpng solve a potential buffer overflow vulnerability[1] in some functions related to progressive image loading. Programs such as mozilla and various others use these functions. An attacker could exploit this to remotely run arbitrary code or crash an application by using a specially crafted png image.These new releases also solve other minor bugs such as some memory leaks in reading image functions.Since most applications which display images use libpng, this affects many applications including Evolution and Mozilla. Additionally, Red Carpet links libpng statically and needs to be updated separately.Ximian only ships libpng on Solaris, and so we only have Solaris packages available. When distribution vendors update their packages, they will be available in Red Carpet. Please use Red Carpet to upgrade libpng to 1.0.14 and Red Carpet 1.3.4-2. You can also get packages from the Ximian FTP site:Solaris 7/8 ftp://ftp.ximian.com/pub/ximian-gnome/solaris-7-sun4/libpng-1.0.14-1.ximian.1.sparc.rpm ftp://ftp.ximian.com/pub/ximian-gnome/solaris-7-sun4/libpng-devel-1.0.14-1.ximian.1.sparc.rpm ftp://ftp.ximian.com/pub/ximian-gnome/solaris-7-sun4/red-carpet-1.3.4-2.ximian.1.sparc.rpm_______________________________________________ updates maillist  -  updates@ximian.com http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/updates Please DO NOT reply to this list!

"&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;K&quot; == Kragen Sitaker  writes:    K&gt; Planning battle tactics; for this reason, the intelligence     K&gt; press reports, spy satellites have had 1-meter resolution for     K&gt; many years.The military already have these spy satellites; they are basically Hubble pointed the other way, so I doubt they will be a big enough customer of this service to justify a next-generation wireless network rollout for the rest of us.    K&gt; Finding an individual vehicle in a city might occasionally be     K&gt; possible with 1-m images and might occasionally also be worth     K&gt; the money.My car is only just over 1.5 meters across and maybe 3 meters long, so that means roughly six pixels total surface area.  You might find a 16-wheeler this way, but how often do people misplace a 16-wheeler such that it is _that_ important to get old images of the terrain? Since they can&#x27;t send up aircraft to update images in realtime every time, how is this different from just releasing the map on DVDs?  Why wireless?I thought of the common problem of lost prize cattle, but there again, will there really be business-case for creating a hi-res map of wyoming on the fly instead of just doing what they do now and hiring a helicopter for a few hours?    K&gt; For small areas you have legitimate access to, it&#x27;s probably     K&gt; cheaper to go there with a digital camera and a GPS and take     K&gt; some snapshots from ground level.  Aerial photos might be     K&gt; cheaper for large areas, areas where you&#x27;re not allowed --- or,     K&gt; perhaps, physically able --- to go, and cases where you don&#x27;t     K&gt; have time to send a ground guy around the whole area.I can see lower-res being useful for Geologists, but considering their points of interest change only a few times every few million years, there&#x27;s not much need to be wireless based on up-to-the-minute data. I expect most geologists travel with a laptop perfectly capable of DVD playback, and I also expect the most interesting geology is in regions where the wireless ain&#x27;t going to go ;)I don&#x27;t mean to nit-pick, it&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m curious as to (a) the need for this product that justifies the extreme cost and (b) how we&#x27;d justify the ubiquitous next-generation wireless network that this product postulates when we /still/ can&#x27;t find the killer app for 3G.--  Gary Lawrence Murphy  TeleDynamics Communications Inc  Business Advantage through Community Software : http://www.teledyn.com &quot;Computers are useless.

"california update 7 / 25 / 01 p . 3 details are still rough and the situation is very fluid , but here is what is currently going on : senators hertzberg and keeley are amending both sb 78 xx and ab 82 xx . upon an initial read , it appears that they are doing the following : ab 82 xx has been gutted except for the direct access provisions and the renewables portfolio . ( the core / non - core business provisions , the transmission asset purchase , etc . all appear to have been deleted . ) both of these provisions that have been left in the bill were seen as positive by members last week when the bill was first debated . it appears amendments have been made to sb 78 xx but the extent of these changes are not yet known . at the beginning of both amended bills , it states , &quot; as proposed to be amended into sb _ xx . &quot; this means that amendments to sb 78 could be incorporated into ab 82 , and vice versa . another possibility is an entirely new bill .",0

It&#x27;s worth thinking about. [1] http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/000541.php ",0

"comparative method ( shared sound changes ) alice faber &#x27;s very sound posting brings up a very important point : indvidual sound changes , especially those which are known to be common in languages of the world , cannot be the basis of subclassification . what you need is either sets of unrelated changes ( english has diphthongized some of the same long high vowels as high german , so that eis and ice , haus and house sound rather similar , but they do not share other changes ) , or a chronology of the sound changes with respect to other changes ( e . g . , the diphthongization in english was presumably preceded by the loss of / x / or / c , / , but there is no such change in high german ) . on the other hand , we find that the northern uto - aztecan languages share the changes of intervocalic / l / - ) / n / , / n / - &gt; velar nasal , and / c / - &gt; / y / . any one of these would mean little , but all three together ( and the fact that the / l / - ) / n / does not feed the / n / - &gt; / ng / change ) make it reasonably certain that these really are shared innovations , and that northern uto - aztecan is a genuine classificatory unit ( a valid node in the uto - aztecan tree , if you will ) - - something that has until recently been generally doubted .",0

It&#x27;s in the same &gt; redhat/linux/beta/limbo directory on the ftp servers. Just check the &gt; redhat-release package to find out which version is on the server.  &gt; Looking at ftp.redhat.com, the current one is redhat-release-7.3.93-2. &gt;  &gt; If you&#x27;re using GNOME2 from the beta, I&#x27;d upgrade as there were some &gt; important bugfixes since the first beta. The only thing to watch out &gt; for is that Limbo2 switched gcc to 3.2, which is once again &gt; incompatible with the previous gcc (v3.1 shipped in Limbo1).Eeeek... I hope they aren&#x27;t intending to release a new RH with a new gcc which hasn&#x27;t yet been released (again). Bad enough the first time, and I&#x27;m sure it gave RedHat a lot of embarrassment.FWIW, I&#x27;ve yet to compile apt on the gcc 3.2 snapshot in RawHide - apt&#x27;s C++ makes several rather poor assumptions on what iterators are, and in addition doesn&#x27;t use namespaces at all.For non-C++ folk, this basically means it needs porting. I&#x27;ve got a reasonable way along, now, and I&#x27;ll send a suitable patch to Connectiva or somewhere when I succeed - I can&#x27;t find anything on Connectiva&#x27;s site itself for this.In addition, the rpmlib stuff has changed slightly - I&#x27;ve not really started on this, but it&#x27;s mainly just arguments added. The rpmlib documentation seems somewhat poor, though, unless I&#x27;ve missed it.Dave. _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list ",0

"Don&#x27;t know if everybody knows this trick...Puts 127.0.0.1 as the IP for adservers. Elegant.==http://technoerotica.net/mylog/hostfile.htmlAs mentioned throughout this site, there is more than one way to skin a cat when it comes to pop-ups. The hosts file is one of the most effective methods there is. In brief, a hosts file is a text file used by Windows to resolve domain names and IP addresses. If you&#x27;re running windows, you already have a hosts file but it most likely isn&#x27;t being used.What a hosts file does is simple, it lists domains and IP numbers. To get rid of ads, the hosts file lists the domain names of adservers along with the IP number 127.0.0.1. This tells windows to grab any content from the listed domain from the specified IP number. The specified IP number in this case is your own computer. What happens is that it won&#x27;t display the ad. If you choose this method of ad removal there is no need to use our opt out links. The hosts file is a very effective mechanism.You can download this hosts file, unzip it and place it in your Windows directory. YOU SHOULD MAKE A BACK UP of your existing hosts file before you do. The hosts file is called &quot;hosts&quot; there is no extension. You may have a file named Hosts.sam this is merely a sample hosts file.Once you download the file and put it in the windows folder, reboot your computer and it&#x27;s a done deal. Pretty simple huh? You might want to look at the contents of this file as it contains additional information as well as an address for getting updated versions. Because we&#x27;re inherently lazy, this works for windows only, don&#x27;t use it on a mac! Follow the address in the hosts file for alternative system instructions. download now  We didn&#x27;t write this file and do not provide support for it&#x27;s use. Follow the address in the hosts file for questions. It&#x27;s not that we don&#x27;t want to hear from you but the folks at this address have the answers you need.http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork ",0

" Kenneth Nerhood said:&gt; I too am seeing very weird things with 2.42 and AWL.  I  installed a &gt; fresh system, and then ran a bunch of test spam through it (all from the &gt; same user).  All messages should have scored over 15.  The AWL kept &gt; adjusting them down so that after about 10 message I had a negative &gt; score.  I&#x27;m using spamc/d.That&#x27;s exactly what is intended; the idea is that legit senders who habitually score just &gt; 5, will eventually get out of &quot;AWL hell&quot; after 6-10 messages.Note that running a single spam through &quot;spamassassin -a -t&quot; *will* eventually whitelist the spammer.  but that&#x27;s why the man page tells you not to do it ;)--j. ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven. http://thinkgeek.com/sf _______________________________________________ Spamassassin-talk mailing list Spamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk ",0

"Quoting Niall O Broin :&gt; I&#x27;m installing warm standby disks on a number of boxes. These disks will be &gt; the same size (sometimes bigger) than the main disk. The idea is that every &gt; night I&#x27;ll rsync the partitions on the main disk to the standby disk so &gt; that &gt; in the case of disaster, the first port of call, before the tapes, is the &gt; standby disk. (We did consider running Linux md RAID on the disks but RAID &gt; gives you no protection against slips of the finger)Do I get beaten round the head for saying &quot;floppy&quot;? Assuming the machines are networked, let each one send a copy of its kernel to the others.  If the drives are open-the-box-and-switch-cables, then you can start dd&#x27;ing a floppy before you start.  If the drives are in drawers, then this might slow you down by all of 60 seconds.Alternatively, you could use netboot.  No, I&#x27;m serious.  Set the boot sequence to first hard disk then network.  Do NOT make any partition on the standby active.  Have a look at the etherboot package.  One of the things it contains is a pascal-ish language for writing boot menus.  You can write a one-liner that basically says &quot;boot /dev/hda1&quot; (or whatever, there&#x27;s example code).  IIRC, the resulting &quot;bootable image&quot; is a whopping 4K.  The downside is you&#x27;ll need a bootp and tftp server somewhere....hth, Ronan. --  Irish Linux Users&#x27; Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

"&gt;  in adding cream to spaghetti carbonara, which has the same effect on pasta as &gt;  making a pizza a deep-pie; I just had to jump in here as Carbonara is one of my favourites to make and ask  what the hell are you supposed to use instead of cream?  I&#x27;ve never seen a  recipe that hasn&#x27;t used this.  Personally I use low fat creme fraiche because it  works quite nicely but the only time I&#x27;ve seen an supposedly authentic recipe  for carbonara  it was identical to mine (cream, eggs and lots of fresh parmesan)  except for the creme fraiche.Stew --  Stewart Smith Scottish Microelectronics Centre, University of Edinburgh. http://www.ee.ed.ac.uk/~sxs/ ------------------------ Yahoo!

"Hello. I meant to contact http://taint.org webmaster, Am I correct, I hope?Actually, I am not quite sure... Did I or Natasha Fedorova write  you before to your other address? Anyway, now I am here instead of  her too.So, my name is Oksana Svetlova, I live in St. Petersburg, Russia.I have an idea, how we could cooperate to mutual benefit, see,  possibly you will find it interesting.People are seeking to cut costs with this economy slow-down, right?The thing is that I could get you in touch with developers from Russia, who will be happy to do a web designer&#x27;s work for you for considerably less, than you possibly take from your clients (or  pay for web-design?), and with _professional_ quality. Also - all programming, Internet-programming, graphic, flash design, content writing, translations, etc. If you do web-design, then you may accept more orders at once, getting a good share from each, and devote yourself only to that work, you find most interesting. Alternatively, you can realize more your ideas to develop, more features to add to your existing sites, and with low costs: from $12, and an average of $18 an hour.I have put links to their works at www.antee.com/samples_and_faq.htmlAs for reliability, I just saw, how carefully they hand-picked their specialists, and under what tight management they do their projects. So, from past experience, it was almost always possible to meet  deadlines. Also, communication is properly thought-out: a consultant  is online in ICQ and other instant messengers almost each day, also  their company has local consultants in many states throughout the  USA, in Europe and Australia.So, what do you think? A possibility for cooperation?Thank you very much, Oksana Svetlova. oksana@antee.comPS. Just in case you need any type of IT works now, please let me  know a bit of details, they will return you a cost/time estimation. ",1

"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85516333 Date: Not suppliedAll through October, Berkeley&#x27;s Mathematical Sciences Research Institute is  hosting Cinemath, a mathematics film festival:     Permutations and Configurations: A Calculated Cinema     In this avant-garde subset of Cinemath, we explore films that have been      constructed using mathematical concepts both simple and complex- geometric      permutations, musical frameworks, even topography are among the strategies      that have been employed to compose and sequence film frames. Filmmakers      such as Oskar Fischinger and Walther Ruttmann created some of the earliest      avant-garde films by multiplying, dividing, and otherwise transforming      abstract images- including spirals, rectangles, and circles to produce      dynamic rhythms and harmonies. Today such visual music and motion graphics      are the currency of digital graphics. Anthony McCall&#x27;s film performances      such as Line Describing a Cone create 3-D geometric shapes into which the      viewer can literally step. We also explore films by pioneers of      machine-generated and computer-produced animation (Norman McLaren, James      and John Whitney, Stan Vanderbeek) as well as works by contemporary      animators who use the computer to either generate or pattern images (Larry      Cuba, Paul Glabicki, James Otis). Peter Kubelka, Taka Iimura, and Standish      Lawder use the frame as the unit with which they create editing patterns,      while Kurt Kren and Paul Sharits reckon on arithmetic systems to variously      calculate compositional or editing patterns. Bette Gordon, Hollis Frampton,      and Bruce Elder figure in algorithms, group theory, and set theory to      graphically enliven the frame or to structure their films. While no      mathematical knowledge is required to enjoy these films, we count on you to      try to calculate the mathematical systems employed!

"I&#x27;ve got some really interesting wav files here.A friend had a Windows CD with, wait for it . . .Every Beatles Record ever released in the U.K.! Including the Christmas and  BBC special albums!

I like the albums, but  would prefer to be able to sellect tracks to play rather than entire albums  and be able to listen to all my music with one app. I know xmms has a WAV  plugin, but it does not recognise these either.Any help will be greatly appreciated!Cheers, John Gay --  Irish Linux Users&#x27; Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

"&gt; Ouch ;-)  Although I&#x27;m not ready to give up razor just yet, I&#x27;d like to &gt; see a pyzor check in SA.  I don&#x27;t think it even needs to be written in &gt; perl.  SA is actually calling razor-check and razor-report as well as &gt; dccproc for those checks so it should be nothing more than duplication &gt; of coding to add pyzor.I don&#x27;t know from Pyzor, but I&#x27;ve always thought that the way services like Razor and DCC could be truly useful is if there were a bunch of different ones.

You &gt; &gt; still need to have the rpm for the specified kernel installed, but at &gt; &gt; least it doesn&#x27;t have to be currently running. It&#x27;s kinda hackish, so &gt; &gt; if someone has a better way to do this, let me know. &gt;  &gt; That idea looks good although it maybe needs to be tweaked a bit more (what &gt; you sent doesn&#x27;t support packages named &quot;kernel-smp&quot;). I&#x27;d also prefer a &gt; cleaner way than the env variable, and preferrably not editing the spec... &gt; probably &quot;--define &#x27;target 2.4.xx-xx&#x27; --with smp&quot;. Sound good enough? &gt; The BuildRequires on &quot;kernel-source&quot; will also need to be removed because &gt; it won&#x27;t necessarily need to be true, and that does bug me a bit :-/The &quot;--define&quot; is exactly what I was looking for! I was trying to figure out a way to do it within the mechanism of rpm (like the &quot;--with&quot; switches), but for some reason didn&#x27;t think of using &quot;--define&quot;. My computer is currently gone for repairs, but once it&#x27;s back, I&#x27;ll rewrite the specfile, add support for kernel-smp, and email it to the list for further criticism :)As far as requiring kernel-source, I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s a big problem. If you&#x27;re gonna go to the trouble of packaging custom kernels into rpms, it&#x27;s not a far stretch to package the source tree too (as I currently do).Also, I&#x27;ve found that the alsa-driver source needs a usb-related patch  to compile under the latest test kernels (2.4.20-preX). Are other  people seeing the same thing, or is this just a problem with my setup?garyP.S. If I didn&#x27;t mention it before, thanks for the alsa packages! They  greatly simplified what used to take way too long before._______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list ",0

"Has anyone had much positive experience with PKI based smartcards, email  (S/Mime interoperability), programming to smart cards, etc.?One area in particular that seems surprising is that a number of  projects are using cards like the Datakey 330 which seems to store data  in a way that is proprietary to particular card/reader driver versions.I&#x27;ve been told, on the other hand, that Java PKI smart cards are very  interchangable and upward compatible.

If the CD is still in the cache, maybe you don&#x27;t even have to insert it. Or choose it from a step-through UI. Instead, you just wave it at an electronic eye of some sort... and the player recognizes it from the  silkscreening.

"re : 3 . 405 languages in the context of &quot; who speaks languages ? &quot; let me comment on how one becomes a linguist . michael kac writes : &gt; i suspect , though i am not sure , that you could take this even further . my &gt; experience suggests that most linguists get interested in the field as the &gt; result of a second language learning experience - - or at least that such an &gt; experience has an important influence on them . this might be true for many linguists . i would like to generalize this observation : it seems to me that many linguists have entered the field because at some point in their lives they have had trouble with using language or with communication in general . this could have been while learning a ( first or ) second language . this could have been because of growing up in a multi-language environment or because of a physical handicap such as stutter . linguistics then serves as a ( formal ) tool to compensate for this deficiency . i can vividly remember how i struggled with german punctuation rules in 6th grade and how i felt relieved when i began to understand the structure of sentences and how this knowledge could be applied to find the correct spot for commas , etc . this started my interested in linguistics and that is how i ended up as a ( computational ) linguist . i &#x27;d be very interested to learn if there is more evidence for my hypothesis . martin volk * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * martin volk * university koblenz - landau tel ( + 49 ) 261-9119 - 469 * institute of computational linguistics * rheinau 3 - 4 fax ( + 49 ) 261-37524 * w-5400 koblenz , germany email volk @ brian . uni-koblenz . de * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *",0

"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1Ok, time for me to pipe in.  :)Honestly, I find it odd that the spam fighting groups aren&#x27;t working and playing well, when the common enemy is the spammers, not each other.  MAPS and ORBS had a battle for a while, and now DCC seems to have issues with Razor.  Honestly, work on your own stuff, and let&#x27;s fix the spam problem, not pull out rulers.In a spam filter, I&#x27;m much, much more concerned about false positives than false negatives.  Additionally, since spam types are so varied, I use all available and trustworthy (to me) methods to detect it.  I tend to want something that has three levels (although nothing like this exists, yet):        red     is most certainly spam, verified by high ratings from                 several sources, and noone says &quot;I know this is NOT                 spam.&quot;  I&#x27;d probably drop this into a bit-bucket, or                 archive it for humor value.  I expect no                 false-positives to be here.        yellow  This may be spam.  A human should decide (and report).        green   This is probably not spam.spamassassin does something useful here, but it only has the is/isn&#x27;t switch, not is/maybe/isn&#x27;t.  That said, razor is but one check in my spam fighting arsenal, so if it reports &quot;doesn&#x27;t match known spam&quot; once in a while for well-known spam, something else will probably get it.- --Michael -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1.0.7 (NetBSD) Comment: See http://www.flame.org/~explorer/pgp for my keysiD8DBQE9Uxknl6Nz7kJWYWYRAqZVAKCAD46joOEZbIk+8Hx3ZGkVQ7eGZwCfRB+V T67XLOPP4vG99Fg2h72gHek= =Evue -----END PGP SIGNATURE----- ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven. http://thinkgeek.com/sf _______________________________________________ Razor-users mailing list Razor-users@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/razor-users ",0

"What I understood was that the activists on the train refused to pay for the food and other items they acquired from the Muslim vendors -- then taunted them.That may not be true, but it would put things in a more interesting light.  Taking food from a small vendor in India and not paying them is trying to starve them.It sounded consistent with the ideas and purpose of the train full of activists.I&#x27;m rarely an apologist for Muslims anywhere.  Yet I find my sympathies with the Muslims in this case, even after they burned the train. &gt; From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of &gt; Stephen D. Williams&gt; The pity of it is that some &gt; Muslims were ready to give it to them. Their murderous attack on the &gt; train-load of VHP activists at Godhra (with its awful, atavistic echoes &gt; of the killings of Hindus and Muslims by the train-load during the &gt; partition riots of 1947) played right into the Hindu extremists&#x27; hands.

IMHO, Java is superior because the problem &gt; of programming in the future is not about 0&#x27;s and 1&#x27;s, making the compiler &gt; 2% faster, or making your code take 5% less memory... It&#x27;s about design &gt; patterns, architecture, high level stuff...Considering 90% of the fake job posting I see are for embedded systems or device drivers - C still rules the world.&gt; 3.  Java is not just a programming language! It&#x27;s also a platform... There &gt; is NOTHING like the standard API&#x27;s in Java in C and C++.  Everyone defines &gt; their own API&#x27;s, people end up solving the same problems ten different waysThe problem is the problem you&#x27;re trying to solve is never the same. Java will soon suffer API-rot (alot of poeple are already complaining about it), it&#x27;s just new. C was clean in the beginning too. API-rot is PURELY a function of age.&gt; 4.  If you have a program of any type of high complexity written in C, you &gt; can&#x27;t possibly think that you could port it to different platforms within &gt; the same magnitude of cost as Java....I do this all the time, It&#x27;s alot easier then you think if the original programmer had a clue at all... Java does remove the clue requirement tho, just adds a huge testing requirement, QA guys aren&#x27;t as cheap ;)&gt; 5.  Makes no sense for a scientific or a business project to depend on a &gt; person... Java, IMHO, reduces the dependence of these entities on the &gt; individual developer as it is much easier to reverse engineer Java as it is &gt; to reverse engineer C (large applications).No it&#x27;s not, but you can hire teams of Javites for cheap at your local high school. Java is about cutting costs and commoditizing programming - and it&#x27;s working!- Adam L. &quot;Duncan&quot; Beberg   http://www.mithral.com/~beberg/   beberg@mithral.com ",0

If Eircom are not up to scratch, then use somebody else and make sure you let Eircom know why you think they are so useless.

I thought it was odd that someone wanted to send the MIME blurb to the list, but it was not really that different from causing the New York Times web site to send a story to the list.

" Of course they had to do this AFTER we purcahsed these all on vhs, and yes it is now run by the great evil empire known as disney...but we got the new School House Rocks DVD anyway and man is it an amazing item.First off , my 8 year old has been singing them since she was 6. Second off, these are much easier to rip to divx and mp3. Third, new songs, remastered originals and other dvd goodies. Its a 2 dvd set so its well worth the 17$ we paid for it.Even if you dont have kids, run do not walk to pick this one up.Man, I would sure love to have a *nix Rocks for the kids. ",0

This was covered in one of the amateur rags, maybe Sky and Telescope or even Scienterrific American, long before there was any web to speak of, but you&#x27;d think a 400km gash in the Earth would be pretty easy to find ;) I remember it from an issue perhaps in the very late 80&#x27;s or early 90&#x27;s.It&#x27;s interesting to note that NT7 and many other NEO bodies are all on trajectories that approach the Earth from under the ecliptic, so with the Earth tilt, South America becomes a pretty good target.  In trying to find you a site through Google, I turned up several different impact sites in Venezuela and Brazil, with ages ranging from 251M to 70 years, but not the 400km gash from the above story.  The only google refs I found from that period is one in Arizona (famous impact crater) and another in NM; do wish I had noted the actual South American /country/ that contains the scar; Venezuela sticks in my mind but I can&#x27;t be certain.  http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/images/meteorcrater.html--  Gary Lawrence Murphy  TeleDynamics Communications Inc Business Innovations Through Open Source Systems: http://www.teledyn.com &quot;Computers are useless.

To be honest, I&#x27;m trying to &gt; &gt; think of a useful use of hard links right now, and I&#x27;m a little &gt; &gt; stumped. There&#x27;s gotta be some benefit that I&#x27;m missing that&#x27;s &gt; &gt; immediately obvious to everyone. &gt;  &gt; Using Niall&#x27;s example - single set of files but &gt;1 namespace, and suppose that &gt; you want to delete some items from the set according to rules applied to the &gt; namespaces.  With soft links you need an *extra* namespace the others refer to, &gt; and after filtering the namespaces, you have to do a manual reference count to &gt; decide what goes and what stays.  With hard links, you just unlink and deletion &gt; is automatic.Couldn&#x27;t have put it better myself, but that&#x27;s not going to stop me trying :-)  The above situation occurs precisely because of the major functional difference between symbolic links (AKA soft links, or symlinks to their friends) and hard links. Two hard links to the same file are exactly equivalent - one is no more the files &quot;real&quot; directory entry than is the other. OTOH a symlink is a special thing which is a link to a real file, and when the file linked to is erased, you end up with a broken symbolic link - you can&#x27;t have a broken hard link (except of course in the case of a banjaxed filesystem).

"phonology / phonetics casali , roderic f . ; resolving hiatus ; 0-8153 - 3149 - 5 , cloth ; pages , $ 59 ; garland publishing ; outstanding dissertations in linguistics this study investigates two alternative ways in which languages resolve sequences of adjacent vowels ( hiatus ) : deletion of one of the vowels , or coalescence of the adjacent vowels to form a third vowel that combines features of both the originals . although existing phonological theories predict relatively few restrictions on the behavior of either process , a survey of 92 languages reveals a number of surprising and previously unreported limitations on their behavior . for example , although deletion of the first of two vowels is extremely common and can apply in any position , deletion of the second vowel is restricted to certain well-defined morpho-syntactic contexts , such as the boundary between a root and a suffix . these restrictions , are explained in terms of functionally-motivated constraints that favor preservation of phonological material in certain prominent positions , such as in root morphemes . in the case of coalescence , the study reveals a surprising correlation between the structure of a language &#x27;s vowel inventory and the result of merging high and a non-high vowels . this correlation is explained in terms of a novel theory of acoustic height features whose detailed specification is determined by functionally-motivated constraints sensitive to the number of vowel heights within a particular language . e - mail : info @ garland . com",0

"    Date:        Sun, 22 Sep 2002 22:21:49 -0700     From:        Brent Welch      Message-ID:  &lt;200209230521.BAA11218@blackcomb.panasas.com&gt;  | I would encourage folks to play with those 10 lines of code in   | Text_Selection and report what works well for them.  We may come up   | with 8 lines that work for everyone, or perhaps introduce yet another   | setting that lets folks choose between a few useful models.  Of course,   | that&#x27;s an admission of policy failure, but I&#x27;m willing to do that.I actually think you&#x27;re looking in the wrong place.   I, at least, have almost no problems with the choice of what gets pasted, or selected, that stuff (for me, if perhaps not users of some gnome variant, which appraently has been fixed anyway) all seems to work just fine.The problem is that a button 1 click clears the selection (PRIMARY) where it shouldn&#x27;t - the previous selection should only be cleared when there&#x27;s something else to replace it (even if the highlighting of what is selected is removed).     Try this in any other ramdom application (from xterm to netscape) and see how it works.  There normally is *no* (mouse based) way to actually clear the primary selection (that is, set it to be a null string).Then, because of the &quot;if I get asked for the selection value, I will find something&quot; behaviour, if you click (intending to set the insert point, the way most other GUI&#x27;s operate), and then paste, because the PRIMARY is clear, but exmh still owns the selection, because nothing else has taken it, it does and finds some other ramdom stuff, from either the clipboard or cut buffer, which tends to be something that was deleted back in the ancient past, and pastes that.That behaviour, to me anyway, is the real issue.Once that gets fixed, we can switch back to operating the normal &quot;select stuff, click at new insert point, paste&quot; mode of operation that almost everyone expects to work (whether the &quot;select stuff&quot; is somewhere in one of the exmh windows, or elsewhere).kreps: this message is from my experience as a exmh user only, I&#x27;ve never really understood enough about X and selections to go gazing at that part of the code and see how it all really operates._______________________________________________ Exmh-users mailing list Exmh-users@redhat.com https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users ",0

" The United States has a program, called Diversity Immigrant Visa Lottery (better known as the Green Card Lottery), making available each year by random selection 50,000 permanent residence visas (Green Cards) to people from around the world. The objective of the program is to issue Green Cards to individuals born in countries with historically low levels of immigration to the United States. A Green Card is a Permanent Residence Visa of the U.S.A. A Green Card will give you legal right to work and live permanently in the United States. Green Card holders receive health, education, and several other benefits. If you win a Green Card, you can apply for U.S. Citizenship at a later time. The Green Card does not affect your present citizenship. You and your family could be lucky winners! Your email address was obtained from a purchased list, Reference # 00193.

"english only in a recent posting , sxren harder ( sharder @ ling . hum . aau . dk ) brings up an interesting point ( quoting from steinberg ( 1993 ) &quot; an introduction to psycholinguistics &quot; ) : &gt; the law reflected the widespread belief that the german language was the &gt; embodiment of all that was evil in german culture and that to teach such &gt; a language to young americans would be immoral and corrupting . &gt; . . . lawyers for the state of nebraska took essentially the position &gt; . . . [ that ] a language by its very nature represents the spirit and &gt; national character of a people . if this were true , then by teaching them &gt; the grammar , structure and vocabulary of the german language , meyer could &gt; indeed have been harming american children by making them into german &gt; militarists right there on the plains of nebraska . - interesting , because in several recent postings against the english - only movement , an argument was given that teaching foreign _ languages _ was good because it exposed students to other _ cultures _ . that is precisely the reason the teaching of the german language was banned , according to the above quote . i think most of us would agree that the state of nebraska was wrong ; teaching another language does not serve to any great extent to pass on the culture . but if you believe that , are n&#x27;t you being hypocritical to believe that teaching foreign languages is good because it exposes students to other cultures ? fwiw , i have a personal opinion : if you want to expose students to other cultures , it would be much better to teach ethnography than language . ( better yet , send the students to non-tourist areas of other countries . but i doubt whether the us educational system is prepared for that ! )",0

"re : 6 . 199 ipa why must this kind of stuff be decided by a vote ? since obviously ipa membership does not equal interest in the matter and never will , all that will be achieved if some of us join the ipa just to force this issue , is that it will be &quot; packed &quot; in some other way than the way it is now , but it will never be representative . why not let the invisible hand of the &quot; market &quot; of ideas operate freely instead ? as fewer and fewer people use ipa &#x27;s made-up symbols , either that organization will become completely irrelevant , or it will make up its own mind to respond to the &quot; market forces &quot; , or perhaps some other group will step in and by proposing a system that is manifestly better than anyone else &#x27;s , achieve standardization that way . i really think that if a few of the top names in phonetics got together with the editors of a few journals , they could probably come up with something . it could also simply come from anywhere else : if someone were to publish a truly superior system and people started using it . finally , in reality , it seems that certain trends are occurring anyway and that in particular the resistance to the hachek and the use of the corresponding ipa symbols are on the wane . if we can put up with the inconsistencies of american vs . canadian vs . british spelling , we can probably do just as well here . and if we are gonna worry about something , i would worry more about those cases where te same symbols have different commonly used meanings like &#x27; j &#x27; and &#x27; y &#x27; . alexis mr",0

" ... nor what color your passport?More American exceptionalism: &gt; &quot;The United States is the only country in the world to tax its citizens &gt; on a worldwide basis, irrespective of whether they spend time in the &gt; country or whether they have assets there,&quot; said Philip Marcovici, &gt; a Zurich-based lawyer with international law firm Baker and Mackenzie.and perhaps even irrespective of their current citizenship:&gt; Under current expatriation law, there are wealth thresholds based on &gt; net worth which lead to a presumption that a person giving up U.S. &gt; citizenship is doing so for tax reasons. &gt; &gt; Individuals who have given up their citizenship and who have earned &gt; $100,000 in any one of the 10 years before expatriation, or who have a &gt; net worth exceeding $500,000, would automatically be deemed a so-called &gt; &quot;taxpatriate.&quot; Those persons would be subject to ordinary income tax &gt; on U.S. source income for 10 years. They would also be subject to &gt; U.S. estate and gift tax during the 10-year period.I suppose it could be much worse; there could be some twee affinity program for US citizenship, and a bank of phone people who only get paid well if they manage to keep one from cancelling membership...-Dave:::::::&gt; Last month, Congress proposed a new exit tax on all citizens who give up &gt; their U.S. status. If the proposal becomes law, individuals will be taxed &gt; as if they had either sold everything or died. This would give rise to &gt; immediate exposure to capital gains tax.To be fair, would this mean that they&#x27;d also immediately pay out the difference for anyone whose tax basis was greater than current estate value?::::::: &gt; ...

"I have a strange problem with one user in a small network using ssh. Everyone in the network uses ssh and they run an ssh-agent on login. This works fine for conveniently wandering around the network and to some of our external boxes - or did, until today. Suddenly, when one user (alfred) tries to ssh anywhere he&#x27;s asked for a password. He says He changed nothing (don&#x27;t they all) but I do actually believe him. I used ssh-keygen to make new keys but that didn&#x27;t help. I created a new user alfio into whose home directory I copied alfred&#x27;s .ssh directory - alfio can wander around free as a bird without being asked for a password ever (except of course for the passphrase to load the identiy into the agent).In case there was something else in Alfred&#x27; environment, I copied .??* from alfred&#x27;s home directory to alfio&#x27;s, remembering to change ownership afterwards. Still alfio is as free as a bird.We use only SSH2 with DSA keys. An extract from a ssh -v for alfio is belowdebug1: got SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT debug1: authentications that can continue: publickey,password debug1: next auth method to try is publickey debug1: userauth_pubkey_agent: testing agent key /home/alfio/.ssh/id_dsa debug1: input_userauth_pk_ok: pkalg ssh-dss blen 434 lastkey 0x80916f0 hint -1 debug1: ssh-userauth2 successful: method publickeyand before starting this ssh attempt, ssh-add -l for alfio said:1024 07:4c:7c:90:0d:28:41:3a:95:c2:81:3d:ba:c4:3d:03 /home/alfio/.ssh/id_dsa (DSA)whereas with alfred the same segment of the debug log wentdebug1: got SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT debug1: authentications that can continue: publickey,password debug1: next auth method to try is publickey debug1: userauth_pubkey_agent: testing agent key /nfshome/alfred/.ssh/id_dsa debug1: authentications that can continue: publickey,passwordand before starting this ssh attempt, ssh-add -l for alfred said:1024 07:4c:7c:90:0d:28:41:3a:95:c2:81:3d:ba:c4:3d:03 /home/alfred/.ssh/id_dsa (DSA) This problem is definitely related to alfred as a user - it happens when he logs in on differing workstations (all NFS mounting the same home directories) and the other users (including good old alfio) don&#x27;t have any problems.

"latest vince , i appologize for shipping another version of the paper so soon after the last . however , my wife picked me up for some last minute shopping at noon and i wasn &#x27; t sure i would get back to this before leaving tomorrow . the only changes in the two documents related to a sentence or two in the intro plus the addition of &quot; unused information &quot; at the end of the document . the unused stuff is made up of notes i made from hamel , some news stories , press releases , and random thoughts . we probably won &#x27; t use any of this stuff but i wanted you to have it just in case it might prove useful . the challenge we face at this stage ( and where i can most use your help ) is in documenting enron &#x27; s risk management functions in a meaningful way . this may be best done through examples or in some other way . i think that our audience would appreciate our including some numerical and detailed examples ( even if they are to be placed in boxes or sidebars that don &#x27; t interrupt the flow of the article . if you &#x27; ll make a pass at what you feel is appropriate i &#x27; ll gladly polish on the words as i try to learn about what you are doing myself . vince , i really am enjoying this learning experience . you guys make a wonderful &quot; lab &quot; . sally and i are driving to louisiana to pick up her mom tomorrow and then driving to new orleans and back to waco by saturday . however , i will check in my e - mail regularly . your friend , john - enron transformation paperl 2 _ 19 _ 00 . doc john d . martin carr p . collins chair in finance finance department baylor university po box 98004 waco , tx 76798 254 - 710 - 4473 ( office ) 254 - 710 - 1092 ( fax ) j _ martin @ baylor . edu web : http : / / hsb . baylor . edu / html / martinj / home . html",0

"Message----- From: Damien Morton [mailto:damien.morton@acm.org] Sent: Saturday, 17 August 2002 02:55 To: &#x27;polrev@hoover.stanford.edu&#x27; Subject: Re: Al Qaeda&#x27;s Fantasy Ideology Youre right of course - the attack was performed for its effect on muslims, not for its effect on the US. By showing that it can be done, they inspire others to follow in their path, or so they hope.I take some objection to the belabouring of the term fantasy, because it is somewhat perjorative. Imagining different worlds can often lead the world to become more like that imagined. Moreso if action is taken on the basis of those imaginings.Theres an interesting parralel with the great capitalist dream that anyone can make anything happen through hard work and a bit of luck. This is equally a fantasy, but one made to approach reality through consensus.An interesting question then becomes, if Al Queda&#x27;s actions are in furtherance of a fantasy, what fantasies are George Bush&#x27;s actions in furtherace of? How many of the actions of George Bush and the US are performed for their effect on the US population? For example, how much showmanship has been put into rebuilding the morale of wall street. Is this not as much a spirtual investment as the sacrifices Al Queda made?What cultural myopia is in play here in the US?I make a point of reading Australian, Britsish and US news. Today I noticed that the Australian and British news are featuring the Iraqi overtures to the UN on inspectors, while US news is featuring Iraqi war preparations (digging bunkers etc).At a time that the US is withdrawing from international cooperation on multiple levels, the fantasy of being surrounded by enemies (invisible preferably) is somewhat appealing. A self fullfilling prophesy, if you like. Perhaps that&#x27;s whats at work here.http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",0

"Anyone heard of this law before?&gt; Q. Can I get a playlist? &gt; A. We are unable to offer a playlist. The Digital Performance Right in  &gt; Sound Recordings Act of 1995 passed by Congress prevents us from  &gt; disclosing such information. The Digital Law states that if one is  &gt; transmitting a digital signal, song information cannot be  &gt; pre-announced. It is a Music Choice policy not to release a playlist of  &gt; upcoming or previously played songs.Recently, MusicChoice upgraded their website with a very important  service, as far as I&#x27;m concerned: real-time song info from their  website. My DirecTV receiver is up on a shelf (and its display scrolls  intermittently); and I&#x27;m surely not going to fire up my projector while  listening to the &quot;radio&quot;, so I&#x27;m quite happy that I can retrieve r/t  song info with URLs like:http://backstage.musicchoice.com/songid/channels/soundsoftheseasons.asp http://backstage.musicchoice.com/songid/channels/rap.asp http://backstage.musicchoice.com/songid/channels/opera.asp etc...Now, if I were a more eager hacker, I&#x27;d write up little WSDL stubs for  these event streams (they&#x27;re clearly not worried about load, since their  own web pages specify 15 sec meta-refresh) and then feed &#x27;em through a  content router to alert me to cool songs.

"fw : london - lpg book lousie , i would be grateful if you could review the transaction below , which will require your approval . as outlined below the client &#x27; borealis &#x27; wishes to change the terms of the contract given our current situation . rac is comfortable with the changes , as it will result in a significant saving in storage costs and allow the lpg trader to flatten his book . further , whilst there maybe the potential of mtm movement between the $ 180 purchase price from borealis and the subsequent sale ( index related price ) back to the counterpart , this will be netted out . rac has significant risk appetite for this counterpart , which is a sound credit , rated e 5 . the only issue is whether houston has sufficient resources or are willing to pay the storage costs early , which could range between $ 1 , 200 , 000 - ? 1 , 400 , 000 . if this is feasible i will recommend that we negotiate a discount of $ 15 on storage costs ( saving $ 600 , 000 ) as opposed to $ 10 . kind rgds , nish - - - - - original message - - - - - from : petersen , bo sent : 27 november 2001 17 : 45 to : patel , nish subject : london - lpg book enron put 40 , 000 mt of propane in storage under a term agreement ( contract qa 8318 ) in a facility in sweden , managed and owned by a company called borealis . enron , under the contract , agreed to pay $ 45 per mt for the right to utilize the storage . due to swedish law , enron can / could not have title to the product in sweden and borealis paid enron , under a pre - agreed price formula , $ 186 per m / t . upon enron &#x27; s sale of the product and subsequent lifting a payment of the $ 186 + $ 45 ( storage fee ) would become due to borealis . the likely timeframe for selling the product would be jan . 2002 as that is the highest otc swap price mkt which in turn would mean payment to borealis would be due on 30 days past b / l . ie early feb . borealis are very concerned about enron &#x27; s ability to meet it &#x27; s payment obligation and has suggested a transaction that in several ways would suit the lpg book . pls let me know if you need further information . bo petersen 1 . an upfront payment ( this week ) of the storage payment with a reduction of $ 10 - $ 15 dollars for the storage fee . $ 400 , 000 - $ 600 , 000 savings 2 . borealis would purchase the product in tank at an indexed related price which would fit the london lpg book very well 3 . the contractual obligations to lift the storage tons would be further complicated by the fact that the one physical trader most likely will not be here much longer . pls let me know if you need further information . bo petersen",0

"&gt; If the text recognition algorithm/architecture humans use is anything &gt; like the algorithm/structure we&#x27;ve been working with, the reason the &gt; first letter (and to a lesser extent, the last letter) is important is &gt; that without it the text pattern recognition problem is exponentially &gt; more difficult (from a theoretical standpoint anyway) and has to be &gt; resolved using deeper abstraction analysis.  The middle letters are far &gt; less important and computationally much easier to resolve correctly.I think keeping the number of middle letters consistent with the correct spelling is important.  Would be interesting to see if this same effect is applicable to written forms of other languages, maybe even Japanese romongi.Bill ",0

"case against theft also acknowledges that the value to the thief is often far less than the value to the victim. Stealing my $1,000 sterio and then fencing it for $50 does not result in &#x27;no loss&#x27; the the economy overall. For the same reason that voluntary transactions increase social value, involuntary ones decrease it. If the sterio was worth as much to the theif as it was to me he&#x27;d buy it ...On the flip side of this, common law allows a breach of property law in precisely the type of scenarios where a net social gain is recorded but the owner&#x27;s availability to make a contract was problematic. Breaking into your isolated cabin because I&#x27;m starving, for example, is permissible if I later offer restitution for the damage I caused and the food I ate.&gt; -----Original Message----- &gt; From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of &gt; Russell Turpin &gt; Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2002 6:25 AM &gt; To: fork@spamassassin.taint.org &gt; Subject: Re: David Friedman: Mail Me the Money! &gt; &gt; R.

"Why am I so passionate about decentralization? Because I believe some of  todayâ€™s most profound problems with networked applications are caused by  centralization.Generically, a centralized political or economic system permits only one  answer to a question, while decentralization permits many separate  agents to hold different opinions of the same matter. In the specific  context of software, centralized variables can only contain one valid  value at a time. That limits us to only representing information A)  according to the beliefs of a single agency, and B) that changes more  slowly than it takes to propagate. Nevertheless, centralization is the  basis for todayâ€™s most popular architectural style for developing  network applications: client-server interaction using request-response  communication protocols.I believe these are profound limitations, which we are already  encountering in practice. Spam, for example, is in the eye of the  beholder, yet our email protocols and tools do not acknowledge the  separate interests of senders and receivers. Slamming, for another,  unfairly advantages the bidder with the lowest-latency connection to a  centralized auction server. Sharing ad-hoc wireless networks is yet a  third example of decentralized resource allocation. Furthermore, as  abstract as centralization-induced failures might seem today, these  limits will _not_ improve as the cost of computing, storage, and  communication bandwidth continue to plummet. Instead, the speed of light  and human independence constitute _fundamental_ limits to centralized  information representation, and hence centralized software architecture. ",0

" This may be a little off topic but thought people here would have a better response to this elsewhere.I have setup two MX records (mail and bmail) for my mail server. The one I gave a 10 (bmail) the other a 20 (mail).bmail(10) I gave a 10 because I want all mail to go through this server to be scanned for SPAM and viruses and then relayed to the mail(20) server for delivery.As I understand it, DNS A records are used in a rotating fashion for load balancing, but DNS MX records are used in order or prority, meaning the 10 before the 20 and only 20 if the 10 isn&#x27;t available.But only some of the mail is actually being scanned which leads me to believe that not all of the mail is actually hitting that box and the 10 never goes down.

"Martin A posted: Tassos Papadopoulos, the Greek sculptor behind the plan, judged that the  limestone of Mount Kerdylio, 70 miles east of Salonika and not far from the  Mount Athos monastic community, was ideal for the patriotic sculpture.

"summary : polish phonology not too long ago i posted a request for polish informants who were also linguists in the hope of getting some quick responses to some questions about polish phonology which are not fully addressed in the literature . the response has been tremendous . since the details may not be of interest , and since i am not sure if all respondents want their names used , i will summarize as follows : most respondents report having a contrast between the sequences [ k &#x27; e ] and [ kje ] as well as [ g &#x27; e ] and [ gje ] , where by [ k &#x27; ] and [ g &#x27; ] i mean a fronted velar probably not quite as front as ipa [ c ] , though . a minority of respondents report no contrast , which is apparently the result of a very recent and presumably spreading sound change . of those speakers who do have the contrast , most report also having a similar contrast between [ x &#x27; e ] and [ xje ] sequences , although one or two do not . it is this last contrast , [ x &#x27; e ] vs . [ xje ] ( both distinct also from [ xe ] ) which is of special interest because in attested forms it only appears before one suffix , a rather peculiar one at that . the suffix is spelled - ewicz and it forms last names such as stankiewicz or banachiewicz . it is also clear that such names come from eastern poland , and that the [ x &#x27; e ] pronunciation is thus a borrowing into standard polish from some eastern dialects and ultimately from east slavic ( belorussian / ukrainian ) . synchronically , however , it is a genuine contrast and one of special interest to those phonologists who are interested in the universals governing the possible systems of contrasts ( e . g . , in lexical phonology &#x27;s structure preservation , ) . great thanks to everybody who has responded so far . once i verify whether i am authorized to publicize people &#x27;s names i will post a &quot; nonymous &quot; acknowledgement . any additional information on this topic would be welcome . alexis mr",0

( 1 ) mathematical theory of formal languages . chomsky still gets cited almost automatically for his pioneering work on hierarchies of languages . ( 2 ) philosophy of language . c gets cited a lot for his nativist claims : his arguments are usually rejected . fodor &#x27;s much more radical nativism gets even more attention and even more rejection . c also gets cited a lot in discussions of wittgenstein , usually as an example of the sort of narrow formalist , rule-based view a language that wittgenstein consistently argued against . ( 3 ) psychology . c has frequently claimed that what he is doing is scientific psychology , but this has failed to impress psychologists . the competence / performance distinction , the autonomous language faculty assumption and the concern with ug all put c &#x27;s theoretical constructs beyond the ken of most experimental or empirical psychologists . ( 4 ) biology . it would interesting to know if * any * evolutionary biologists have taken up c &#x27;s views or tried to explain how they could be investigated . again , his views often get mentioned in general introductions . . . but only to be rejected . ( 5 ) cognitive science . as gardner showed in &quot; the mind &#x27;s new science &quot; , c was a source of inspiration . consequently he is cited very frequently in cognitive science literature . again , however , it is his formal , comptuational approach - not his genuinely linguistic work - that are referred to . so , although c is viewed as a founder of cognitive science , his current theory of grammar has had no real impact on the field . in general , it seems that most people outside of linguistics know of chomsky as he appears in &quot; aspects &quot; and in the non-technical parts of &quot; knowledge of language &quot; . it &#x27;s surely a safe bet that almost no non-linguist followed him into &quot; government and binding &quot; . - philip swann",0

I installed it before I knew about apt, but one of the previous emails had an apt repository that claimed to have gnomehide. Just remember there is one kew file that makes the difference between Gnome1 and Gnome2 being used. I *think* it is &quot;gnome-core&quot; vs. &quot;gnome-session&quot; but I can not remember.Note that that those same files are probably in the Limbo beta, except updated.

As I really feel like blending ALSA in now, especially since I&#x27;ve just spent some time recompiling alsa-kernel package for all the Psyche kernels!!!Matthias--  Matthias Saou                                World Trade Center -------------                                Edificio Norte 4 Planta System and Network Engineer                  08039 Barcelona, Spain Electronic Group Interactive                 Phone : +34 936 00 23 23_______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list ",0

It&#x27;s now looping through my OPML blogroll file, checking the first load of  bites in people&#x27;s pages for head linked FOAF files, grabbing certain elements  from these files (if they have one) and spitting them out into a brand new FOAF  file for me.â€  - _Joe Gregorio_: The Well-Formed Web[5]. â€œAfter spending some time  badgering poor Bill Kearney for a concrete benefit of having RDF in RSS 1.0 and  not getting a really satisfactory answer I went back and read Paul Ford&#x27;s essay  again.

" New Page 1Hi,            Want to increase your chances of winning a big jackpot in those             Internet contests?            Michael Khalili, the famous programmer who you may have read about             in USA Today and other newspapers, came up with a method that makes             it hundreds of times easier to win online.            He recently wrote a program that will AUTOMATICALLY enter you in             online contests--over and over UNTIL YOU WIN (or tell it to stop).             We at Grab.com are so excited by this system that we&#x27;re putting it             online for our members to use.             THE PRIZE IS YOURS - GUARANTEED!            If you win a contest using this program, the prize is legally yours             to keep--GUARANTEED! Our lawyers assured us that Michael&#x27;s program             is legal, and online contest sponsors have CONFIRMED that it doesn&#x27;t             violate their rules. So if you win a prize, you&#x27;ll receive it.             If you don&#x27;t receive it, we&#x27;ll pay you ourselves. GUARANTEED.             FREE TO USE.            Best of all, this service is free to use. All you pay for is related             network expenses--which only cost $1 for 7 days of the service.             That&#x27;s dozens of entries for what you&#x27;d usually pay to get a single             lottery ticket!            As a member in good standing of this mailing, we&#x27;ve already             set up the automatic entry system for you. All that&#x27;s left             is for you to turn it on.

Forever.If instead of punching the button, I go out to the keyserver myself and then try the message again, everything works, so it SEEMS that it must be the code that goes out to the keyserver.Anyone else with this problem?

"NFS as a protocol is not known for its speediness but this is absurd. I did an  NFS install of a box this morning (that would be the box which won&#x27;t boot  from CD for those who were in IRC) and it was rather slow but I just left it  to it. Having got it up, I want to copy the DVD to a disk on it so I have it  handy for installing any further bits I might require. So I simply mounted  the NFS exported DVD on the new box and started copying. After a couple of minutes I looked - it was transferring about 8MB a MINUTE.  So I killed that and used rsync instead which is ticking away now at about  100 MB/min - still not exactly turbo charged but a lot better than the NFS  rate. Any ideas as to what&#x27;s making it SO slow ?

"flow change for fuels cotton valley redeliveries into hpl saturday , march 3 , the redeliveries into hpl from fuels cotton valley for the eastrans deal will increase to approximately 19500 mmbtu / dy . this change should continue through march 5 th or 6 th . the reason for the change is an operational emergency . defs typically delivers approximately 12200 mmbtu / dy into txu lone star . this delivery will not be able to occur because the alford b compressor needs to get into the shop for maintenance . this compressor will be out of commission for the month of march . the busby compressor will compress the usual 7300 mmbtu / dy of fuels cotton valley redelivery gas as well as the 12200 mmbtu / dy of txu lone star redelivery gas . a different redelivery point with txu lone star is being established and should be available by march 5 th or 6 th . at this point in time , we will take the hpl fuels cotton valley redelivery gas to zero and balance the redeliveries between the two points . therefore , defs will not change the delivery or redelivery nominations in place for eastrans . after the new txu lone star redelivery point is put into place and the points are volume balanced , it is our intent to have redeliveries of 7300 mmbtu / dy from fuels cotton valley and 22700 mmbtu / dy into pg &amp; e ( which is what is in place effective 3 / 1 / 01 ) for eastrans .",0

I get to see bad CDROM problems all the time. Mostly when vendors buy crap cables to try to save $0.02/each, but there are chipsets and drives with known DMA issues as well.&gt; Normally, even if you try to enable DMA and your device doesn&#x27;t support it, &gt; it simply don&#x27;t be able to make the change, and that&#x27;s it. The problem IIRC &gt; is with crappy hardware that is supposed to support DMA but doesn&#x27;t work as &gt; expected when it&#x27;s enabled... maybe Chris could confirm this? ;-)Usually if you enable DMA on a CDROM that can&#x27;t handle it gracefully you won&#x27;t be able to read data off it relably, and that&#x27;s about it. No end_of_the_world problems, and easily fixed.&gt; I guess I&#x27;ll settle for the /dev/dvd link change as described and putting &gt; the DMA tip in the %description :-)My biggest beef with automatically setting /dev/dvd is that I always seem to have a CD-Burner and a DVD drive (or DVD burner) in the same box, and I usually have the DVD as the second drive /dev/cdrom1 in &quot;kudzu-speak&quot;. I agree that the %description is the best place for the tip. Unless someone can come up with a way to probe CD/DVD drives to divulge their largest supported media size without loading ide-scsi or having that media currently in the drive.--  Chris Kloiber _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list ",0

"re : eprm article chris , this is very well written and will serve the reader well . a few comments . 1 . when i think about the taxonomy of the var models , i typically use the classification based on 3 categories : a . variance / covariance method b . historical simulation c . monte carlo simulation . delta approach is the way of representing a position in a nonlinear instrument . 2 . i would define monte carlo as an approach based on statistical simulation of behavior of all the market prices / rates , etc . , and revaluation of the entire portfolio . the revaluation may be based on an approximation ( using taylor &#x27; s expansion ) that may involve delta , delta / gamma , delta / gamma / omega or may be exact ( based on the same model that produces the mark - to - market portfolio valuations ) . the main benefit of using the mc simulation in the energy markets is the ability to capture the gapping behavior of the energy markets in a straightforward way . i would emphasize that there are attempts to incorporate jumps in the v / c model ( i shall send you the references from home ) . 3 . i would mention that historical simulation may break down in the markets that are evolving quickly ( new instruments for which we have no comparable prices , behavior of prices may change as markets mature or de - mature ) . 4 . for bigger portfolios , virtually all methods require some level of aggregation into atomic , elemental instruments to reduce the dimensionality of the problem . this process may be a source of a big error . 5 . the computational burden of mc can be reduced through clever preprocessing of a portfolio that introduces no error . many swaps with the same underlying can be aggregated into one positions ( they are portfolios of forwards and they are linear instruments ) . please , feel free to use any comment ( or none ) . vince &quot; chris strickland &quot; on 08 / 28 / 2000 02 : 58 : 56 pm please respond to &quot; chris strickland &quot; to : cc : subject : eprm article dear vince , ? d you think you might be able to look at this in the next day or so ? robin is after something by the end of this week . ? best regards . ? chris . ? - eprm _ 01 _ var . doc",0

The client machine would be configured with the same network name, it should be able to auto detect the channel number.Driver support is very good, there are only a few wireless chipsets, and I believe that all but the newest 802.11b Plus (22Mbps) and 802.11a hardware has Linux drivers.If you need anymore help or info checkout the forums and irc channel at .Robert Fitzsimons robfitz@273k.netOn Fri, Aug 16, 2002 at 05:39:21PM +0100, Justin MacCarthy wrote: &gt; I have a small network at home, &gt;  &gt; Connected by 5 port hub.... &gt; &quot;smoothwall&quot; smoothwall server   192.168.1.1 &gt; &quot;shaftoe&quot;  Windows 2000  192.168.1.75 &gt; &quot;gotodengo&quot; Linux    192.168.1.50 &gt;  &gt;  &gt; The family has a new pc I want to plug in, to use the ISDN in smoothwall. &gt; I also have a notebook. &gt;  &gt;  &gt; I want to plug both of these into the network using a wireless connection. &gt; What&#x27;s the best way to do this???

" Matt Kettler said: &gt; Ok, first, the important stuff. Happy birthday Justin (a lil late, but &gt; oh well)cheers!&gt; a 13% miss ratio on the spam corpus at 5.0 seems awfully high, although  &gt; that nice low FP percentage is quite nice, as is the narrow-in of average  &gt; FP/FN scores compared to 2.40.As Dan said -- it&#x27;s a hard corpus, made harder without the spamtrap data.Also -- and this is an important point -- those measurements can&#x27;t be directly compared, because I changed the methodology.  In 2.40 the scores were evolved on the entire corpus, then evaluated using that corpus; ie. there was no &quot;blind&quot; testing, and the scores could overfit and still provide good statistics.In 2.42, they&#x27;re evaluated &quot;blind&quot;, on a totally unseen set of messages, so those figures would be a lot more accurate for real-world use.--j.",0

"http://yorkshirepost.co.uk/scripts/editorial2.cgi?cid=news&amp;aid=481620Close encounter of burnt kindIT came from outer space Â­ or did it? Teenager Siobhan Cowton is convinced the object which struck her as she climbed into the family car at her home in Northallerton is extra-terrestrial. But while her claims are being treated with a certain amount of studied academic scepticism by experts in these matters, the 14-year-old schoolgirl is adamant she was hit on the foot by a meteorite. Siobhan initially thought there was a more prosaic explanation Â­ that the odd-looking stone had been thrown at her by a child,. But on closer inspection, she discovered all was not as it seemed Â­ because it was hot when she picked it up. It hit her on a foot but caused no injury. &quot;I looked at it again and it had a black and grey colour with a shiny bubble surface,&quot; she said. After closer inspection by her father Niel, and comparison with pictures on the Internet, Siobhan plans to ask scientists at Durham University to check the object for authenticity. If it is from outer space, Siobhan says she will consider putting it up for auction. She added: &quot;If it isn&#x27;t worth anything then I suppose I will keep it myself for sentimental value. It is not every day that you are hit by a meteorite.&quot; But Dr Ben Horton, a lecturer in physical geography, was the acme of academic caution. &quot;Meteors have features that can be used to establish whether it is a piece of extraterrestrial rock,&quot; he said. &quot;They have a very smooth surface but sometimes they have shallow depressions and cavities. If they are hot, they should have a black ash like crust burnt around the edge. &quot;Most are between five and 60 centimetres but five centimetres is the smallest that they usually appear.&quot; To establish the provenance of Siobhan&#x27;s suspected meteorite it would have to be subject to a mineral breakdown but Dr Horton thinks the chances of it being extra-terrestrial are slim. &quot;Around 50,000 a year strike the Earth&#x27;s surface and, considering the size of the Earth, it is very unlikely to be a meteorite. &quot;However, there is a possibility and there is no reason it couldn&#x27;t happen,&quot; he added. ------------------------ Yahoo!

( dutch , english , first price - sealed bid , and second - price sealed bid . ) in fact , the selling price is equal to the valuation of the second highest bidder . for example , in vickrey auction , everyone bids at his own valuation . hence , the winner pays the valuation of the second highest bidder . in english auction , the second highest valuation bidder will stop competing if the price is above his valuation . hence , the winner also gets the item at the price of the second highest valuation bidder . thank you for attending the meeting and giving many helpful contributions . - chonawee",0

Errrr....the biz guys in my office don&#x27;t care what the &quot;WISPs&quot; want to do with their little WiFi networks.  And the bandwidth shadows in most cities are surprisingly large and common.  They aren&#x27;t selling the software, which is pretty pricy as it happens.  They are using it to optimize next generation wireless canopies over metro areas and fiber networks on a large scale.  There are an essentially infinite number of metro wireless configurations, some of which generate far more dead or marginal spots and others which are very expensive to operate (due to backhaul transit considerations) or both.  This software can be used as a tool to optimize the canopy coverage and minimize the actual transit costs since the wireless is tied into fiber at multiple points.The canopies we are talking about aren&#x27;t short-range wifi technologies, but a mixture of long-range high-performance wireless networking, with bandwidth measured in tens to hundreds of mbits and ranges measured in miles (up to well over a hundred miles on the extreme end).  At those ranges and bandwidth levels, the cost of providing the network can easily vary by an order of magnitude or more depending on how you manage RF shadows and proximity to fiber access points.  The idea ultimately is to optimize the cost and performance such that no existing network infrastructure providers can remotely compete and maintain profitability.  This is a surprisingly low bar, and it is about time networks were designed with this level of large-scale optimization (cost per mbit, maximizing coverage, and effective bandwidth available per unit area) in any case.  And for this company&#x27;s long-term plans, this type of capability will be absolutely necessary to keep things sane.Or at least investors find this capability very sexy and compelling, especially since we have this lovely visualization engine tied into the system (CLI batches never have the same effect, even if it is more efficient).-James Rogers  jamesr@best.com ",0

"    Date:        Wed, 21 Aug 2002 10:40:39 -0500     From:        Chris Garrigues      Message-ID:  &lt;1029944441.398.TMDA@deepeddy.vircio.com&gt;  | The background color in this window is the same as the background    | color in the ftoc.That&#x27;s what I&#x27;d like to vary - particularly as the ftoc background isn&#x27;t constant - messages in the unseen sequence have a different background than others.In the ftoc that&#x27;s fine, but in the sequences window, it isn&#x27;t needed. unseen already has a different foreground there (no problem with that), it doesn&#x27;t need a different background as well.I&#x27;ll play about a bit with this, and with making it vertical instead of horizontal, and see what turns up.  | The only sequences that are defined there are sequences which are defined   | in app-defaults-color or ~/exmh/exmh-defaults-color.OK.  | I&#x27;ve been thinking about how to dynamically generate highlighting for   | other sequences, but haven&#x27;t got that figured out yet.In this case, highlighting wasn&#x27;t what I was most concerned about. A method to get messages in &amp; out of sequences comes first, how it displays is a secondary consideration.   But as a suggestion, have an &quot;all unknown&quot; sequence highlight, any message in a sequence which has no defined highlighting (where defined includes defined to not be treated specially) gets highlighted the same way (maybe something as boring as a dark brown text colour - almost indistinguishable from the normal black)   | &gt; &gt; Any chance of making the current message a little brighter background?   |    | I don&#x27;t see any reason why not.  Experiment and let me know what works for you.Done some of that.   First, the most significant change came from changing relief from raised to sunken.   I don&#x27;t know why, but it just looks better (for me anyway).   But even with that, cur and unseen are still just a bit too similar.   I ended up using*sequence_cur:  -background {PaleGoldenrod} -relief sunken -borderwidth 2The unnecessary braces are just because some of the colours I was using had spaces in their names.   PaleGoldenrod translates as #eee8aa which is probably safer for generic use.kre_______________________________________________ Exmh-workers mailing list Exmh-workers@redhat.com https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers",0

"take: if genetic engineering includes selective breeding, then it also includes human pairs that are not randomly grouped.It doesn&#x27;t matter if those two intend what they are doing, they are engaged in a &#x27;selected sort&#x27;. It has been brought up that a boss no longer marries his secretary. Now the female law partner selects another high earning mate (at least associate law). So instead of two couples making $140K a piece (100K + 40K) you have one pair with $200 and one pair with $80 and this has some interesting social effects.

So, it&#x27;s neither &gt;&gt; freeing the resources correctly nor reusing them :-/ &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve found several other people seeing the same VSZ issue with pthreads, &gt;&gt; spread over a long time, but no solution as yet. &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Err, Is your code fixed now? &gt; You need a seperate pthread_t per thread.I&#x27;ve tested it with and without separate pthread_t&#x27;s, and the problem is identical, unfortunately.Regards,Vin --  Irish Linux Users&#x27; Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

But there&#x27;s at least two main &#x27;opposing thumbs&#x27; between regedit and gconf:    1. GConf is written in English, not symbol tables; you can actually READ what the heck you&#x27;re looking at.    2. Because it&#x27;s better-considered, it should be more sound; when the registry gets a wrong value, you may not be able to boot....if GConf is scrogged, you can still have all the underlying power of the OS to keep things running....just call up WindowMaker (or whatever) for the next session until you get it worked out.

Filtering spam at the &gt; MUA just seems Greg&gt; stupid to me -- by the time it gets to me MUA, &gt; the spammer has Greg&gt; already stolen my bandwidth. &gt; &gt; The two problems I see with filtering that early are: &gt; &gt;     1. Everyone receiving email via that server will contribute ham &gt; to the stew, making the Bayesian classification less effective. &gt; &gt;     2. Given that there will be some false positives, you absolutely &gt; have to put the mail somewhere.  You can&#x27;t simply delete it.  (I also &gt; don&#x27;t like the TMDA-ish business of replying with a msg that says, &gt; &quot;here&#x27;s what you do to really get your message to me.&quot;  That puts an &gt; extra burden on my correspondents.)  As an individual, I would prefer &gt; you put spammish messages somewhere where I can review them, not an &gt; anonymous sysadmin who I might not trust with my personal email &gt; (nothing against you Greg ;-). &gt; &gt; I personally prefer to manage this stuff at the user agent level.  &gt; Bandwidth is a heck of a lot cheaper than my time. &gt;I see no reason why both approaches could and should not be used. MTA level filtering would just need to use a different corpus, one that  would contain illegal or otherwise commonly unapproved material for the  group of people using that MTA.   I&#x27;m sure that such an approach would  significantly reduce the mail traffic as a first step, without  giving   false positives.MUA corpus would then be personally trained -- although I&#x27;d like the  option of &#x27;down-loadable&#x27; corpuses and merge functionality.HarriPS.

"    &gt;&gt; I wrote a script some time ago to try an minimize the duplicates I     &gt;&gt; see by calculating a loose checksum, but I still have some     &gt;&gt; duplicates.  Should I delete the duplicates before training or not?    Tim&gt; People just can&#x27;t stop thinking .  The classifier should work     Tim&gt; best when trained on a wholly random spattering of real life.  If     Tim&gt; real life contains duplicates, then that&#x27;s what the classifier     Tim&gt; should see.A bit more detail.  I get destined for many addresses: skip@pobox.com, skip@calendar.com, concerts@musi-cal.com, webmaster@mojam.com, etc.  I originally wrote (a slightly different version of) the loosecksum.py script I&#x27;m about to check in to avoid manually scanning all those presumed spams which are really identical.  Once a message was identified as spam, what I refer to as a loose checksum was computed to try and avoid saving the same spam multiple times for later review.    &gt;&gt; Would people be interested in the script?  I&#x27;d be happy to extricate     &gt;&gt; it from my local modules and check it into CVS.    Tim&gt; Sure!  I think it&#x27;s relevant, but maybe for another purpose.  Paul     Tim&gt; Svensson is thinking harder about real people  than the rest     Tim&gt; of us, and he may be able to get use out of approaches that     Tim&gt; identify closely related spam.  For example, some amount of spam is     Tim&gt; going to end up in the ham training data in real life use, and any     Tim&gt; sort of similarity score to a piece of known spam may be an aid in     Tim&gt; finding and purging it.I&#x27;ll check it in.  Let me know if you find it useful.Skip",0

In that way the proxy picks up both the real server and user names from what the mail reader tells it the user name is.This is an N-way classifier (like ifile that way), and &quot;all it does&quot; is insert a    X-Text-Classification:  one_of_the_class_names_you_pickedheader into your email before passing it on to your mail reader.  The user then presumably fiddles their mail reader to look for such headers and &quot;do something about it&quot; (and even Outlook can handle *that* much ).The user is responsible for generating text files with appropriate examples of each class of message, and for running the cmdline tools to train the classifier.",0

And if the latter, what does he need to place in user_prefs to cause such mail to be ignored?  I&#x27;m testing SA here with a few users who happen to be on yahoogroups lists, before deploying it system-wide, and although the above line has been added to their user_prefs files, much of their list mail is still going to the spam folder due to all the usual things you would expect to trigger SA.Thanks in advance for any help.-- Ken Scott, admin@shellworld.net ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same old cell phone?

"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2220922.stm Big cats are on the loose in Britain and breeding their way towards record numbers, a monitoring group has claimed.  The British Big Cats Society said it has received more than 800 reports of animals including pumas, black panthers, leopards and so-called Fen tigers over the past 12 months. And while it admits that many sightings are of nothing more exotic than the average moggy, it claims to have &quot;firm evidence&quot; that the majority are real. Society founder Daniel Bamping told BBC News Online he could cope with the critics and doubters, adding: &quot;I was a sceptic, I thought it was in the same realm as the Loch Ness monster. &quot;But it&#x27;s not, they are really out there.&quot; &#x27;Cats with cubs&#x27; Mr Bamping said there have been reports of big cats from every corner of the country. Big cat reports   Hotspots include Scotland and Gloucestershire  January 2002 - Kent man clawed by suspected Lynx  November 2001 - farmer reports animals mauled by big cat  April 2001 - Lynx captured in north London  1999 - Puma-like cat attacks horse in Wales   &quot;This weekend alone I have had sightings from Wales, the Scottish borders, Kent, the West Midlands, Devon, Somerset and Wiltshire,&quot; he said. The society claims some of the big cats are breeding with domestic animals. But Mr Bamping said others, particularly lynx and puma, probably exist in sufficient numbers to breed among themselves. &quot;We have had sightings of cats with cubs,&quot; he added. &#x27;Trigger camera&#x27; The society claims to have evidence proving the cats&#x27; existence, including photographs, paw prints, sheep kills and hair samples. But it knows it will have to do even more to convince a sceptical public that it is not spinning them a shaggy cat story. A national &quot;trigger camera&quot; project is planned which, the society hopes, will provide footage to prove the existence of the big cats. Mr Bamping said: &quot;The idea is that the cat will walk past the camera and take a picture of itself.&quot; &#x27;Like dogs&#x27; The society believes many of the sighting are of pets released into the wild, or their descendants. Its spokesman Danny Nineham said: &quot;In the 1960s and 1970s, people had big cats like leopards as pets and they used to walk them like dogs. &quot;But in 1976 when the Dangerous Wild Animals Act came into force, people released their cats because they did not want to pay for a licence, put them down, or take them to a zoo.&quot;------------------------ Yahoo!

" Begeman&#x27;s _Manufacturing Processes_ talks about Quality Control Charts:&gt; The tolerance limits for a part are placed outside of the control &gt; limits and are never inside of them.  Once the control chart has &gt; been established, data is recorded on it and it becomes a record &gt; of the variation of an inspected dimension over a period of time. &gt; The data plotted should fall in random fashion between the control &gt; lines, if all assignable causes for variation are absent.  When the &gt; data fall in this manner, it can be assumed that the part is being &gt; made correctly 99.73% of the time; that is, no more than 3 out of &gt; 1000 will leave the process incorrectly made.Taking a look at the S&amp;P 500, and  using the Ibbotson 2000 figures of 13% expected stock return and 20% standard deviation, and taking the the actual 2.5 year return on the S&amp;P since 31 Dec 1999 to be close to -30%, we find:-.30 ? 2.5*(.13) - 3*sqrt(2.5)*(.20) -30% &gt; -60%so it still plots out between the control lines ...&gt; So long as the points fall between the control lines, no adjustments &gt; or changes in the process are necessary.  If five to seven points fall &gt; on one side of the mean, the process should be checked.  When points &gt; fall outside of the control lines, the cause must be located and &gt; corrected immediately.... but maybe we should&#x27;ve checked the process during the &quot;long&quot; bull.-Davehttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork ",0

"sum : ocr software a couple of weeks back i posted a query about ocr software for the mac that is trainable enough to be useful to a linguist scanning latin or ipa - based non - english texts . thanks to jakob dempsey sarah rilling michael betsch andrew arefiev marc fryd and daniel loehr for their responses . in the mac world , it appears that the front-runner in this area is the widely-available omnipage programme from caere corporation ( http : / / www . caere . com for info ) . it is apparently trainable although one respondent expressed some doubts about being able to train it to handle more than a single special font . i should also mention that the first sales rep i talked to previously about omnipage seemed to think that it might have trouble with the combinations of letters and diacrits typical of ipa - based alphabets . however , the publicity literature on the web site seems to imply that it can be trained to recognize combinations of separate characters and the last sales rep i talked to seemed to think that there was no doubt that omnipage could do the job . jakob dempsey also mentioned an &quot; expensive kurzweil product &quot; for the mac , but i have n&#x27;t heard anything further about this . i also got two responses that mentioned windows - based applications that are highly trainable . one is a german product called optopus made by a german company called makrolog in wiesbaden which is &quot; exclusively trainable &quot; - - that is , it needs to be trained from scratch and so can be configured to any alphabet you like . the other is by a russian company called bit software ( www . bitsoft . ru ) ; their programme is called finereader and in addition to having a wide range of set alphabets for langauges using both latin and cyrillic , they report having sucessfully trained it to recognize icelandic and tibetan fonts ) . david beck = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = david beck department of linguistics sixth floor , robarts library 130 st . george st . university of toronto toronto , ontario m5s 3h1 canada e-mail : dbeck @ chass . utoronto . ca phone : ( 416 ) 978-4029 ( 416 ) 923-2394 ( home ) fax : ( 416 ) 971-2688",0

"On Wed, 2002-07-31 at 15:16, Elias Sinderson wrote: &gt; Heh. Never mind the perfectly good desert in the southwest, right? Or is  &gt; that area too hot for desert warfare training? I&#x27;ll never understand. The primary desert warfare facilities and schools ARE in the Southwest, most notably Fort Irwin deep in the Mojave/Anza Borrego (the headquarters and core training facilities for all things desert warfare related), and have been for a long time. There are two reasons that immediately come to mind as to why they do not use the Fort Irwin, Edwards AFB, and other expanses of desert that they have traditionally used for desert warfare training and exercises.  The first is logistical: Virtually all the mechanized infantry units are located east of the Rockies, and it must be very expensive to move entire heavy combat divisions a couple thousand miles every time they want to run training exercises.  This is particularly true since so much of our military is made up of reserve components these days, meaning that you can&#x27;t move the soldiers to where the training facilities are.The second is environmental lawsuits and pending judicial action and injunctions. The desert training facilities in the Southwest deserts have been aggressively assaulted by environmental organizations who are making the case that heavy mechanized units zipping back and forth across the deep desert endanger the desert tortoise and a bunch of other theoretically endangered species that are concentrated in the southwest deserts. The ability of the military to use the desert facilities has been significantly impeded these days while all the lawsuits and whatnot with the various environmental groups are being sorted out.-James Rogers  jamesr@best.com http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork ",0

"takes time and money: noting the amounts of each correction and basing the refund delivery method on the amount. yesh, it&#x27;s silly to spend $.37 (+ labor and materials) for a $.02 refund, but maybe the only alternative right now is to create dichotomies that require even more time and labor - or keep the money (see john hall below). your mailed refund is a function of bulk.in jax we&#x27;re on the verge of firing at&amp;t cable for horrible customer service and over-charging. what will probably happen: if the amount of overage per customer is significant (say $30 or more) the refund will go directly to the customer. If it&#x27;s less, the combined total amount will go to the city as lump sum settlement.in your case, maybe all the customers could vote on line where they&#x27;d like their lump sum to go. of courese, they&#x27;d have to be notified by mail first. :-)-----Original Message----- From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com]On Behalf Of John Hall Sent: Monday, October 07, 2002 5:02 PM To: Fork@xent.com Subject: RE: The absurdities of life. They are legally required to do that. I got a similar check because an insurance company didn&#x27;t pay a claim quickly enough. It might have been $.02.Although they spent lots more than $.33 to mail you the check, the alternative seems to be to keep the money. Do you really want companies to have a financial incentive to over-bill you &#x27;just a bit&#x27; so they could keep it? For a company with millions of customers, $.33/customer starts adding up. &gt; From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of &gt; bitbitch@magnesium.net&gt; So I get a check from Pac Bell today (SBC as they&#x27;re called now). &gt; Turns out, they went to the trouble of printing out, signing, sealing &gt; and stamping a check just to refund me for a whole $0.33. &gt; &gt; They easily spent more than this just getting the materials together. &gt; Why the hell do companies bother to do this crap? I mean, isn&#x27;t there &gt; a bottom line in terms of cost effectiveness? I don&#x27;t think I missed &gt; the .33, but I sure as hell would have appreciated lower rates in lieu &gt; of being returned pennies. &gt; &gt; I&#x27;m truly stuck on this though. I don&#x27;t know whether to frame the &gt; check, burn it, or cash it in. Maybe I should find a way to return to &gt; sender, so they have to spend -more- money on giving me my .33 dues. &gt; &gt; &gt; Does .33 even buy anything anymore? Funny bit of it, is I couldn&#x27;t &gt; even make a phone call these days. &gt; &gt; *boggled* &gt; BB. &gt; &gt; -- &gt; Best regards, &gt; bitbitch mailto:bitbitch@magnesium.net",0

"power trading hi folks : very glad to hear about the new developments . just to recap what we discussed this morning about different things you need to look into to set up trading operations and the contacts : 1 . licence to trade : regulatory people : i guess you know about this part better than me . 2 . trading &amp; risk mgmt : global risk mgmt oversight : john sherrif in london has the overall responsibility outside western hemisphere . research group can help with the structuring models used for trading . 3 . risk conrols : before trading group is operational , it needs to get the authorization from the board of directors of enron along with total position limits and possibly value @ risk limits . these limits are typically by commodity type and by region . risk assessment &amp; control ( rac ) under rick buy performs the internal control function ensuring that the businesses adhere to these trading limits . ted murphy is the vp in rac overseeing the trading operations . the value @ risk models come from the research group , but day - to - day monitoring of the numbers is done by ted &#x27; s group . 4 . credit risk : a credit reserve number is computed for each deal ( again , the models are created by research ) and is transferred to the credit group under bill bradford ( also in rac ) . this is basically like buying insurance from the corp . , so that if there is a couterparty default , the loss is covered by the reserve pool of the credit dept . 5 . legal : the name i was given is alan aronowitz for legal help . 6 . back office : initially can survive with excel spreadsheets . you should contact the it though when the plans finalize to talk about systems . australia is the most recent place where we set up the trading operations . you can talk to paul quilky , the trader there to talk about these issues ( mention to him that grant masson in research gave his name ) . barry pierce in london was incharge of back office at the begin there . i can coordinate for talking with people next week . give me a call monday if possible . i hadn &#x27; t the time to search for the presentation stuff today . will do it next week . krishna .",0

"Craig R.Hughes wrote: &gt; I was thinking you could easily create a spamtrap which you subscribe to  &gt; lots of legitimate nonspam mailing lists, plus you also spread the email  &gt; address around and get it in the hands of lots of spammers so it ends up  &gt; receiving large quantities of both spam and nonspam, then you have it  &gt; apply the algorithm above to the incoming mail stream.  So it could be  &gt; thousands of actual real, different, emails per day.  The &quot;very high  &gt; rate triggers alarms&quot; thing is certainly something which would be  &gt; possible to check for, but there may be legitimate ways to exhibit this  &gt; behavior -- can&#x27;t think of one right now but &quot;AOL proxy server&quot; springs  &gt; to mind as an example from another domain.If there is a maximum trust value (if trust is some sort of percentage for instance), and if it isn&#x27;t impossible to reach it, that would  prevent too few people to get too much of an avantage. My guess is if 1%  of razor users can reach this limit (or be near enough), spammers won&#x27;t  be able to cheat just by building up their trust, they would need a fair  amount of fake users too.Now, for the &quot;fair amount of fake users&quot;, spammers don&#x27;t have access to  many set of network classes. So they would need a bunch of users coming  from the same set of ips. If the razor servers see 100 people on a class  C network (253 ips) reporting 10000 emails a day, something wrong is  going on. This could also trigger alarms.As for legitimate proxies and the like, 1) a proxy should not report any thing (spam should be reported by hand, not automatically), 2) there may  be a way to have exception (IBM networks would have lots of users from  the same set of ips but no likely spammers, so no alarm would trigger  for their network, or better the alarm would be less sensitive). AOL  could still give trouble though but even then, for one particular phone  line/cable, the set of ip is probably quite small even less than a class  C (using network subclassing). The spammers could still try to have  several connections at different locations, but that increases their  cost and so is not so much interesting.

"&gt; Ben Mord said: &gt;  &gt; &gt;Ah. In that case, you can use something considerably less powerful than &gt; &gt;VMWare. All you need is a machine configured to boot from CD-ROM and use &gt; &gt;a RAM disk for scratch space. Numerous Linux distros are available that &gt; &gt;let you boot a stateless but functional system from CD-ROM. &gt;  &gt; But RAM is expensive, and the directory structures of many systems (e.g. &gt; Windows) are not sufficiently organized and standardized to make this &gt; combination of bootable CDs and RAM drives practical. Even if you are &gt; fortunate enough to be using Linux (or another FHS-compliant *nix), you &gt; still can&#x27;t fit a lot on a CD. Its not unusual today to have gigabytes of &gt; static multimedia content on the web server. This particular problem can be &gt; alleviated somewhat by using DVDs, but this is a temporary solution at best &gt; which will become outdated quickly as our data requirements grow and hard &gt; drives become cheaper.So, just write-protect the hard disk for partitions that are static. I seem to recall an article on this (early 80&#x27;s, Byte magazine, perhaps?) for BBS systems or for testing unknown (perhaps trojan horse) software. - George--   ----------------------------------------------------------------------   George Dinwiddie                             gdinwiddie@alberg30.org   The gods do not deduct from man&#x27;s allotted span those hours spent in   sailing.                                    http://www.Alberg30.org/  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ",0

[ n + v ] verbal compounding to be more clear we enumerate the relevant characteristics of our compounds . 1 . first of all , we must say that catalan is a vo language . 2 . our compounding looks like a process of noun incorporation where the incorporated noun within the lexical item is the internal argument in the syntactic structure . observe ( 1 ) ( 1 ) a . el cacador trenca la cama de l &#x27; ocell &quot; the hunter breaks the leg of the bird &quot; b . el cacador camatrenca l &#x27; ocell &quot; the hunter leg + breaks the bird &quot; 3 . nevertheless , the noun-incorporation does n&#x27;t affect to the capacity of the verb of assigning acusative case , this is , the complex verb remains transitive . 4 . generally , this kind of &quot; noun-incorporation &quot; is only possible when the noun incorporated is an inalienable possession noun ( ipn ) and the new internal argument of the complex verb is the possessor . observe ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) : ( 2 ) a . corferir &quot; to heart + hurt &quot; b . colltorcer &quot; to neck + twist &quot; ( 3 ) a . * cadiratrencar &quot; to chair + break &quot; b . * ferrotorcer &quot; to iron + twist &quot; 5 . we hypothesise that the ipn acts as a kind of modifier in the complex verbal form and doestn &#x27; t act as a verbal argument . olga fullana noell lluisa gracia pl . ferrater mora n . 1 universitat de girona e-17071 girona spain fullana @ skywalker . udg . es gracia @ skywalker . udg . es",0

"Marc,The likelyhood of EFF or other mailing lists getting filtered will decrease over time as these mails are revoked whenever they get filtered out. Revocations help the system to punish reporters who report legit bulk mail such that their future reports are automatically considered suspect. As such, with all the new changes to TeS, the likelyhood of filtering mailing list posts has decreased dramatically. Please keep me posted if you see false positives on the EFF newsletter again.cheers, vipul.On Fri, Aug 02, 2002 at 03:22:13PM -0700, Marc Perkel wrote: &gt; Thanks - but it almost looks like someone is deliberately trying to &gt; poison EFF messages.

( 5 ) i spent all day working on the tv . it had better work now . ( 6 ) joe : i can explain why i am late . jane : this had better be good some people say that _ this had better be good _ is a cliche and in ( 6 ) it implies the speaker kas expectations that the excuse will be fanciful or just plain untrue . i would like to thank again to all the people who reponded . if you had any comments on this matter , please email through prof . tanaka to me . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * best wishes , hiroaki tanaka , associate professor , tokushima university , japan hiro-t @ ias . tokushima-u . ac . jp",0

The quote is not suggesting that people use &#x27;./configure&#x27;. 2. The quote is not saying that rpm will _try_ to eval macros even if the user forgot to pass the leading &#x27;%&#x27;. It is saying the opposite: rpm will try to support users who &quot;forgot&quot; to _leave off_ the leading &#x27;%&#x27;. That is what the documentation _says_, but rpm does not follow the documentation. If you leave off the &#x27;%&#x27;, then rpm will not eval the macro, at least for rpm 4.0.4.Confused?Anyway, back to my original problem: what about documentation for the macros &#x27;%post&#x27;, &#x27;%postun&#x27;, and &#x27;%files&#x27;? Here&#x27;s some of what I found &quot;documented&quot; in the the CHANGES file that &#x27;rpm&#x27; includes:Line 46: - macro for %files, always include %defattr(), redhat config only.Line 49: - bail on %files macro.Hmm. So, there is no %files macro?Line 172-174: - add &quot;rpmlib(ScriptletInterpreterArgs)&quot; to track %post -p &quot;/sbin/ldconfig -n /usr/lib&quot; incompatibilities.I&#x27;m unable to find a corresponding description for %postun, but it appears to work just the same. The important things to remember are: 1. Don&#x27;t forget the double-quotes around the -p argument string. If you leave them off, you&#x27;ll get the cryptic error message: error: line #: Package does not exist: %post -p /sbin/ldconfig -n /usr/lib 2. This only works with RPM 4.0.3 or later.&gt; -- &gt; On the first day of Christmas my true love sent to me &gt; A badly configured newsreader &gt; &gt; _______________________________________________ &gt; RPM-List mailing list &gt; http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list &gt; _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list",0

"On Tue, Aug 06, 2002 at 12:56:17PM +0100, kevin lyda mentioned: &gt; sorry, i missed this.  redhat supplies something similar called kickstart &gt; (guess who inspired them?).  pc hardware is dumb, so you&#x27;ll need to use &gt; a floppy.  otoh, every jumpstart config i&#x27;ve seen required rarp plus &gt; plugging the new box&#x27;s ethernet+ip into a file.  a kickstart boot can &gt; just use a dhcp server. I&#x27;ve just been re-aquainted with the Jumpstart stuff after a long absence. There is a nice need &#x27;add_install_client&#x27; script that you feed the archtecture, ethernet address &amp; ip to, and it&#x27;ll setup everything from RARP to Bootparams for you. Very simple. This script takes a -d option, to boot via DHCP also. On the negative side, Sun&#x27;s terminal handling leaves a lot to be desired - it won&#x27;t work properly on a Wyse 120+ for instance, no matter what emulation mode the Wyse is trying to do. To do PC netbooting properly, you need an motherbard with a PXE BIOS. Then you are flying. Heh, how hard would it be to get a PC with an OpenBoot prom ?Kate --  Irish Linux Users&#x27; Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

"&gt; will have problems though if you use Windows, as it will tell wrong time &gt; for half the year, and will reset the clock when you boot into it after &gt; the change in time (this might be fixed in XP/2000, I don&#x27;t know). &gt; Even if you set the hwclock to localtime, you will get problems when you &gt; boot into windows, as both Linux and Windows will try to alter the &gt; hwclock (maybe there is a way to suppress windows doing this). &gt; mHi there,I recently delved into how the linux system clock and the hardware clock interact with each other when I set up ntp on my system while connected to the net. However, I didn&#x27;t realise that Windows altered the hw clock as there was no mention of it in any of the docs I read.  I still dual-boot on a regular basis and if Windows is sneakily messing with the clock, I&#x27;d be interested to know in what way it is and how it couild be stopped from doing so. Everything seems to work fine since I set the system up but I still don&#x27;t like to have these gaps in my knowledge.Regards, Anthony Geoghegan --  The worst sin towards our fellow creatures is not to hate them, but to be indifferent to them.

"[Tim] &gt; OTOH, my Data/ subtree currently has more than 35,000 files slobbering &gt; over 134 million bytes -- even if I had a place to put that much stuff, &gt; I&#x27;m not sure my ISP would let me email it in one msg .[Skip] &gt; Do you have a dialup or something more modern ?Much more modern:  a cable modem with a small upload rate cap.  There&#x27;s a reason the less modern uncapped @Home went out of business .&gt; 134MB of messages zipped would probably compress pretty well - under 50MB &gt; I&#x27;d guess with all the similarity in the headers and such.  You could zip &gt; each of the 10 sets individually and upload them somewhere.I suppose this could finish over the course of an afternoon.  Now where&#x27;s &quot;somewhere&quot;?  I expect we&#x27;ll eventually collect several datasets; SourceForge isn&#x27;t a good place for it (they expect projects to distribute relatively small code files, and complain if even those get big).&gt; ... &gt; How about random sampling lots of public mailing lists via gmane or &gt; something similar, manually cleaning it (distributing that load over a &gt; number of people) and then relying on your clever code and your &gt; rebalancing script to help further cleanse it?What then are we training the classifier to do?  Graham&#x27;s scoring scheme is based on an assumption that the ham-vs-spam task is *easy*, and half of that is due to that the ham has a lot in common.  It was an experiment to apply his scheme to all the comp.lang.python traffic, which is a lot broader than he had in mind (c.l.py has long had a generous definition of &quot;on topic&quot; ).  I don&#x27;t expect good things to come of making it ever broader, *unless* your goal is to investigate just how broad it can be made before it breaks down.&gt; The &quot;problem&quot; with the ham is it tends to be much more tied to one person &gt; (not just intimate, but unique) than the spam.Which is &quot;a feature&quot; from Graham&#x27;s POV:  the more clues, the better this &quot;smoking guns only&quot; approach should work.&gt; I save all incoming email for ten days (gzipped mbox format) before it rolls &gt; over and disappears.  At any one time I think I have about 8,000-10,000 &gt; messages.  Most of it isn&#x27;t terribly personal (which I would cull before &gt; passing along anyway) and much of it is machine-generated, so would be of &gt; marginal use.  Finally, it&#x27;s all ham-n-spam mixed together.  Do we call &gt; that an omelette or a Denny&#x27;s Grand Slam?Unless you&#x27;re volunteering to clean it, tag it, package it, and distribute it, I&#x27;d call it irrelevant .",0

"re : 3 . 396 chomsky citations i think that the large number of chomsky citations in linguistics is unfortunately due largely to the authoritarian nature of the chomsky - spawned linguistics that gets done : theory is simply not acceptable until it has received the imprimatur of chomsky , by his penning an essay or book which incorporates a student &#x27;s or accolyte &#x27;s idea . this is not so much an impugnment of chomsky : i personally think he is a great linguist ( and political observer ) ; it is rather an impugnment of the chomsky disciples . i gather that the ship of modern ( generative ) linguistics is so terribly tossed in the gales of ( what counts as ) science that every hand looks to the captain for guidance . and so , too often , the captain wears a halo . i think that chomsky would be cited less if linguistics was either more of a science than it is or at least more than its practitioners seem to believe .",0

"new book : language processes social and cognitive approaches to interpersonal communication edited by susan r . fussell , carnegie mellon university roger j . kreuz , university of memphis historically , the social aspects of language use have been considered the domain of social psychology , while the underlying psycholinguistic mechanisms have been the purview of cognitive psychology . recently , however , it has become increasingly clear that these two dimensions are highly interrelated : cognitive mechanisms underlying speech production and comprehension interact with social psychological factors , such as beliefs about one &#x27;s interlocutors and politeness norms , and with the dynamics of the conversation itself , to produce shared meaning . this realization has led to an exciting body of research integrating the social and cognitive dimensions which has greatly increased our understanding of human language use . this volume contains a collection of papers by noted social and cognitive psychologists illustrating this theme . each chapter demonstrates how the theoretical approaches and research methods of social and cognitive psychology can be successfully interwoven to provide insight into one or more fundamental questions about the process of interpersonal communication . the topics under investigation include the nature and role of speaker intentions in the communicative process , the production and comprehension of indirect speech and figurative language , perspective-taking and conversational collaboration , and the relationships between language , cognition , culture , and social interaction . the book will be of interest to all those who study interpersonal language use : social and cognitive psychologists , theoretical and applied linguists , and communication researchers . 0-8058 - 2269 - 0 [ cloth ] / 1998 / 312pp . / $ 59 . 95 0-8058 - 2270 - 4 [ paper ] / 1998 / 312pp . / $ 32 . 50 lawrence erlbaum associates , inc . orders @ erlbaum . com",0

"translation translation into the second language stuart campbell paper 0 582 30188 2 224 pages 1998 applied linguistics and language study series longman the dynamics of immigration , international commerce and the postcolonial world make it inevitable that much translation is done into a second language , despite the prevailing wisdom that translators should only work into their mother tongue . this book is the first study to explore the phenomenon of translation into a second language in a way that will interest applied linguists , translators and translation teachers , and esol teachers working with advanced level students . rather than seeing translation into a second language as deficient output , this study adopts an interlanguage framework to consider l2 translation as the product of developing competence ; learning to translate is seen as a special variety of second language acquisition . through carefully worked case studies , separate components of translation competence are identified , among them the ability to create stylistically authentic texts in english , the ability to monitor and edit output , and the psychological attitudes that the translator brings to the task . while the case studies mainly deal with arabic speakers undergoing translator training in australia , the conclusions will have implications for translation into a second language , especially english , around the world . &#x27; translation into the second language &#x27; is firmly grounded in empirical research , and in this regard it serves as a stimulus and a methodological guide for further research . it will be a valuable addition for advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students of applied linguistics , translation theory , bilingualism and second language acquisition as well as those involved in teaching or practising translation at a professional level . stuart campbell associate professor in language studies , and director of the language acquisition research centre at the university of western sydney macarthur . further information on the books published in this series , and the table of contents for this title can be viewed at the longman linguistics on-line catalogue at : http : / / www . awl-he . com / linguistics for a complete listing of our world-wide offices , please click below : http : / / www . awl-he . com / offices available for review",0

The savannah monitor lizard was captured at Chapel St Leonards, Lincs, on Sunday by a member of the public before being collected by an RSPCA team. RSPCA officer Justin Stubbs, who took the lizard to a specialist carer, said: &quot;Savannah monitors can give a nasty bite and we certainly wouldn&#x27;t have wanted one loose in a busy holiday resort for long.&quot; Officials believe the animal may have been abandoned by a private owner because it has not been reported missing. Savannah monitor lizards originate in Africa and are carnivorous, eating rats and small rodents. They can grow to 4ft in length. Anyone with information about the lizard can contact the RSPCA in confidence on 08705 555 999.------------------------ Yahoo!

You have      to show them that you know the routine and that you know you don&#x27;t have to      give them anything, and just have a low-key demeanor. But if you get angry,      that&#x27;s just going to make things worse for you. You get out of your vehicle      and you walk up to them -- you don&#x27;t try to avoid these guys; you don&#x27;t try      to avoid their eyes -- you go up with a big smile, give them a big      handshake and sort of rub their shoulders and say, &quot;Hey, great to see you.      You&#x27;re my new best friend for the next five minutes.&quot;     GROTH: Basically act like a used car salesman.     RALL: It&#x27;s exactly like that! You always carry cigarettes.

"eskimo words for &quot; snow &quot; , &quot; ice &quot; , etc . as an eskimologist and an anthropologist , i strongly concur with woodbury &#x27;s and hill &#x27;s recent messages on the topic . i have two responses : one to the person who suggested that maybe what was peculiar about eskimo words for snow is not the number of lexical items to be found in a dictionary , but rather that these words are used more often and even by non-specialists within the culture . i am sorry that i can&#x27;t track down the name of this person , which i must have deleted by mistake . but this is an interesting idea . my answer is that eskimos talk about snow about as often as a sahara tuareg would talk about rain , in other words , not very often . remember that the arctic is technically a desert ; i . e . there is very little precipitation , although whatever snow that does fall remains on the ground , an ~ rd is blown a } iround into funny shapes , for which there is of course , a technical terminology , used mainly by huntersd who need to use these things as landmarks . snow ( as a ground cover or falling ) is really not very important to eskimos . i suggest that we start looking at some of the languages of the subarctic groups of canada ( cree , chipewyan ) , these people live in deep snow , and probably talk about it a lot more ! my second response is for george fowler who suggest that there might be an fashion of eskimo words for - - - - - going on . he talks about 50 words for ice in greenlandic . he was speaking facetiously , of course , but there is a point to be made here . eskimos who hunt on ice ( such as the siberian yupik eskimos i worked with ) have an incredibly detailed technical terminology for ice conditions , icebergs , ice thickness and movements . for eskimo hunters , these things are concretely a matter of life and death . so eskimos do have many words for ice , and as for snow , this is a technical terminology , and as for snow , it is entirely based on a few stems that actually mean &quot; ice &quot; , and on many stems that do not fundamentally mean &quot; ice &quot; . so , at least in some eskimo languages , such as cnetral siberian yupik eskimo , there are actually more expressions ( or if you want &quot; words &quot; ) for &quot; ice &quot; than for &quot; snow &quot; . for the definition of a &quot; word &quot; and &quot; stem &quot; in eskimo , i refer y &#x27; all back to woodbury &#x27;s statement . the point is that technical terminology for things that interest eskimos is no different from technical terminology that is relevant to , say , swiss cuckoo clock makers . willem j . de reuse dept . of anthropology university of arizona tucson , az 85721",0

In other words, the size and shape of the tips of gecko foot &gt; hairs--not what they are made of--determine the gecko&#x27;s stickiness. &gt; &gt; To verify its experimental and theoretical results, the gecko group then &gt; used its new data to fabricate prototype synthetic foot-hair tips &gt; from two &gt; different materials. &gt; &gt; &quot;Both artificial setal tips stuck as predicted,&quot; notes Autumn, assistant &gt; professor of biology at Lewis &amp; Clark College in Portland, Ore. &quot;Our &gt; initial prototypes open the door to manufacturing the first biologically &gt; inspired dry, adhesive microstructures, which can have widespread &gt; applications.&quot;",0

"     Tim&gt; I gave it all the thought it deserved .  It would be     Tim&gt; wonderful to get several people cranking on the same test data, and     Tim&gt; I&#x27;m all in favor of that.  OTOH, my Data/ subtree currently has     Tim&gt; more than 35,000 files slobbering over 134 million bytes -- even if     Tim&gt; I had a place to put that much stuff, I&#x27;m not sure my ISP would let     Tim&gt; me email it in one msg .Do you have a dialup or something more modern ?  134MB of messages zipped would probably compress pretty well - under 50MB I&#x27;d guess with all the similarity in the headers and such.  You could zip each of the 10 sets individually and upload them somewhere.    Tim&gt; Can you think of anyplace to get a large, shareable ham sample     Tim&gt; apart from a public mailing list?  Everyone&#x27;s eager to share their     Tim&gt; spam, but spam is so much alike in so many ways that&#x27;s the easy     Tim&gt; half of the data collection problem.How about random sampling lots of public mailing lists via gmane or something similar, manually cleaning it (distributing that load over a number of people) and then relying on your clever code and your rebalancing script to help further cleanse it?  The &quot;problem&quot; with the ham is it tends to be much more tied to one person (not just intimate, but unique) than the spam.I save all incoming email for ten days (gzipped mbox format) before it rolls over and disappears.  At any one time I think I have about 8,000-10,000 messages.  Most of it isn&#x27;t terribly personal (which I would cull before passing along anyway) and much of it is machine-generated, so would be of marginal use.  Finally, it&#x27;s all ham-n-spam mixed together.  Do we call that an omelette or a Denny&#x27;s Grand Slam?Skip ",0

"http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,806579,00.htmlLioness adopts fifth antelopeRory Carroll, Africa correspondent Tuesday October 8, 2002 The GuardianKamuniak the dysfunctional lioness has forfeited another meal by adopting her fifth baby oryx this year, an aberration of nature which has baffled wildlife experts. The young lioness in the Samburu national park in northern Kenay adopted her latest baby at the weekend, a wildlife service warden said yesterday. Each time Kamuniak, whose name means &quot;the blessed one&quot; in the local Samburu tongue, has tried to protect the antelopes from other predators and allowed the natural mothers to feed them. Unfortunately for her, one oryx ended up in the belly of a male lion while Kamuniak slept; the others were either rescued by wardens or retrieved by their natural mothers. The wardens think the latest adoptee, nicknamed Naisimari (&quot;taken by force&quot;), was adopted at the weekend. &quot;She must have adopted her on Sunday because they are in harmony,&quot; said Gabriel Lepariyo, a warden. Naisimari&#x27;s natural mother has been seen shadowing the odd couple at a distance. Theories to explain the phenonemon abound: not having her own cubs, Kamuniak is lonely; she is colour-blind and short-sighted and thinks the calves are cubs; the oryx were too frail to flee, breaking the classic prey behaviour and confusing the hunter; Kamuniak wants to be a vegetarian; Kamuniak wants to be loved. ------------------------ Yahoo!

"Paul Kelly mentioned: &gt; gcc has been as good as or better than pgcc for quite a while. pgcc was &gt; was written back in the days when gcc splintered due to a perception of &gt; slow progress on the main branch. A number of Linux distributions wound &gt; up using egcs, partly derived from the pgcc work as I recall. Happiness &gt; was restored to the world with gcc 2.95 and later.I do not have the time to follow the compiler &quot;wars&quot;, but I notice that I must use egcs to build 64 bit SPARC code.GCC 3 should do it, but because it is so &quot;buggy&quot;[1] it is not worth trying to use unless you really want to track down those compiler errors... :(- Matthew[1] &quot;buggy&quot; in the sense that its a feature. Many of the problems with GCC 3 seem to be related to stricter syntax checking. More accurate information will be appreciated. __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?

It&#x27;s completely transparent. The ratings and the feedback is there for all to see. Most importantly it relies on the individual to make the decision for themselves rather or not to trust a buyer/seller.Contrast this with TeS which utilizes &quot;sooper secret&quot; methodologies to determine rather or not a submitter is trusted or not and at what point something becomes spam at some level of &quot;confidence.&quot;The unfortunate thing is that in my experience Razor is an incredibly ineffective filter at this point. The spot checking I&#x27;ve done indicates about a 40% hit rate. Submissions I made a week ago still don&#x27;t count as spam, apparently because I&#x27;m not trusted enough, or enough people haven&#x27;t submitted the item, or some unknown combination thereof. Why anyone would continue to waste their time submitting items when they aren&#x27;t being accepted due to a series of calculations which will not be shared is beyond me.Any trust model that cannot survive public scrutiny isn&#x27;t worth trusting IMHO./\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\                                Patrick Greenwell          Asking the wrong questions is the leading cause of wrong answers \/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/ ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same old cell phone?

"california power 1 / 19 / 00 1 . legislation passes - short - term measures , very long - term measures as we said yesterday , sb - 7 x passed the california state senate easily . the bill gives the state the immediate authority to purchase power via the department of water and resources until february 2 nd . the department will have $ 400 million available to finance power purchases , but there expectations that these costs could easily rise to $ 1 billion by next week . ab - 1 x has evolved into a longer - term solution and in its current form , would authorize the department of water and resources to enter into long - term contracts ( as opposed to the 15 day contracts in sb - 7 x ) to buy power at a price cap of 5 . 5 cents per kw / h . this legislation is not expected to pass today and will likely be changed considerably during the upcoming two week period covered by sb - 7 x , when negotiations between generators , the utilities , and the state are likely to resume . a second piece of legislation under - - sb 6 x - - has created uncertainty in the markets . this legislation will create a california public power authority with bond issuance authority . the uncertainty concerns whether the new authority will address the problem of the $ 12 billion in outstanding debt owed by the utilities . the current text of the legislation focuses only on longer term measures such as expanding generation capacity and improving efficiency . yet the legislation also says &quot; the authority may issue bonds , exercise power of eminent domain , and enter into joint power agreements and buy , own , and sell land and facilities necessary for the financing of a project . &quot; the general nature of this language leaves open the possibility of either issuing bonds to finance past debts , or using eminent domain or the bond authority to finance the utilities as they enter into a ch . 11 proceeding . 2 . default update 3 . bush as we reported on wednesday , the bush administration continues to demonstrate little interest in getting involved",0

"n - ary vs . binary lloyd anderson asks how n-ary ( for n greater than 2 ) comparison could ever be worse than binary . consider the problem of heads and tails when we toss coins . what are the chances of two coins ( standing for two languages obviously ) both coming up the same ( i . e . , both heads or both tails ) when tossed once ? since there are four possible outcomes of the binary toss , namely , hh , ht , tt , and th , and only two where both come up the same , the chances are 50 % . but now consider what happens when we toss three coins ( standing for three languages ) . since a coin only has two sides , in each possible outcome at least two of the coins come up the same . so the chances of 2 out of 3 coming up the same ( which would correspond to saying let two out of three languages agree in something and then they are related ) are 100 % ( which means this is not a valid test for relatedness ) . of course , if we had wanted all 3 out 3 to come up the same , then the situation would be drastically different , but in linguistics n-ary comparison never to my knowledge involves such a requirement . however , the only reason that n-ary comparison does so poorly here is that ( a ) there are only two possible outcomes per language , i . e . , languages come in only two varieties , and ( b ) the number of languages being compared is small ( only three ) . the ( a ) part is the one where real linguistic applications are drastically different from our little coin-tossing game ( since when you look for language relationships , you are looking at hundreds or thousands or maybe even more possibilities , not two , because you are looking at phonological shapes of morphemes mostly , and these allow lots of possibilities , at least thousands ) . so in the real situations that alone insures that n-ary comparison is better than binary . but it is also true that if you increase the number of coins ( languages ) in ( b ) , that also has the same effect . but you still have to be careful : the main concern is that given n languages being compared you must worry about how many out of the n are required to agree and about not making that number too small ( if you do , then again chance tends to take over ) . which raises a question : is there any published work on comparing languages which explicitly calculates these numbers ( and does it right ) ? alexis mr",0

So we&#x27;re all in agreement then.  Except for Marc.So what brilliant metric do you have in mind to measure unsolicited vs. solicited commercial email?I know I&#x27;ve registered for many commercial lists that send material that really reads like spam.  Moreover, spammers will be able to circumvent SA if they make spam look like this SCE.  This kind of convergence of the two.... well, it stinks.  We can kill SCE, or we can cripple identification of UCE.Obviously an interim solution is to whitelist, but long term is probably harder.  What kind of SCE, like MSDN newsletters, product updates, etc is in the corpus for the GA?  Maybe seeding the corpus with a bigger set of these type of mails will have some interesting/useful results.Ross Vandegrift ross@willow.seitz.com ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven. http://thinkgeek.com/sf _______________________________________________ Spamassassin-talk mailing list Spamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk ",0

Years ago, to my five &gt; year old brain, my dad used to inform me that I had &#x27;smegma&#x27; in my &gt; eye, and would proceed to extricate it. I don&#x27;t think there is a specific word in English for eye goop.  However, when I was halfway literate in Tagalog, I learned that there is a specific word in that language (or was it another dialect?) for it: muta, pronounced &quot;MOO-ta&quot;.  Even though my Tagalog has faded greatly, I automatically use that word for &quot;eye goop&quot; when speaking English (how often does that happen?), mostly because it apparently filled a linguistic hole in my brain and therefore permanently wedged itself into my vocabulary.Not that this is important, but I&#x27;ve inadvertently adopted &quot;muta&quot; into my version of the English language as the word for &quot;eye goop&quot;.  Arguably better than &quot;smegma&quot; anyway.(Definitely Friday...)-James Rogers  jamesr@best.comhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork ",0

Here is a  list of things I intend to re-read once the fog lifts: - _Phil Ringnalda_: Using FOAF relationships[1] and Just say no to Trackback in  index.html[2].  - _Les Orchard_: Per-post comment RSS feed[3].  - _Phil Wainewright_: The bare necessities of RSS[4] and What to do about RDF [5]. The beginning of an RSS 2.0 best practices document.  - _Jonathon Delacour_: Trying to score a goal[6]. â€œAs the best and the  brightest focus on the possibilities of FOAF, I turned my attention to  yesterday&#x27;s news: RSS.â€ No, RSS will always be today&#x27;s news. Get it?  Today&#x27;s newzzz... Never mind.  - Comments on Ben Hammersley&#x27;s Friend of a Friend[7]. Various ways to link to a  FOAF file from an RSS feed.  - _Nicholas Chase_: The Web&#x27;s future: XHTML 2.0[8]. We&#x27;re losing backward  compatibility, isn&#x27;t that great? Well, he seems to think so.  - mod_cc[9], a module for including copyright information in RDF documents such  as RSS 1.0 feeds, and, I hope, FOAF files.  - _Shelley Powers_: Who is your audience, and what are you trying to  accomplish?[10] Addressing the growing identity crisis on the RSS-DEV mailing  list[11]. Also the comments on Shelley&#x27;s article[12].  - _Ian Hickson_: Pingback 1.0[13]. â€œThe best thing about this idea is  that unlike similar schemes like TrackBack, it is totally transparent to both  users.â€  - New software helps in building of accessible web sites[14]. A press release  for a new edition of LIFT[15], which I have never used.  - Forget Mars bars, Twinkies now the deep-fried treat[16]. â€œThe secret to  making a deep-fried Twinkie, he says, is to place it in the fridge first to  give it more stability. He then rolls it in flour, covers it with batter ...  and plunks it into the oil.â€ [1]  http://philringnalda.com/archives/002324.php [2]  http://philringnalda.com/archives/002329.php [3]  http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000290.phtml [4]  http://howto.looselycoupled.com/blog/2002_09_15_dy.htm [5]  http://howto.looselycoupled.com/blog/2002_09_22_dy.htm#85480973 [6]  http://weblog.delacour.net/archives/000707.html [7]  http://rss.benhammersley.com/archives/001387.html [8]  http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-xhtml/?n-wa-9192 [9]  http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/cc/ [10] http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/000541.php [11] http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rss-dev/ [12] http://burningbird.net/cgi-bin/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=541 [13] http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1032794857&amp;count=1 [14] http://maccentral.macworld.com/news/0209/23.usable.php [15] http://www.usablenet.com/ [16] http://www.globeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/PEstory/TGAM/20020923/UFATTN/Headlines/headdex/headdexInternational_temp/13/13/22/ ",0

"the latest - http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/2240487.stmFriday, 6 September, 2002, 08:53 GMT 09:53 UK Zimbabwe eases GM stanceZimbabwe has dropped objections to accepting genetically modified (GM) grain so that urgently-needed food aid can be delivered, says the UN food agency. The executive director of the World Food Programme, James Morris, said Zimbabwe&#x27;s decision would send an important message to other countries in the region which have refused food aid because it might contain GM grain. Until now, Zimbabwe had said it would only allow aid workers to distribute ground maize to allay fears that GM grain could be planted. But a Zimbabwean minister says the government has now set up a system of checks to ensure the grain will not enter the eco-system. There have been fears that Southern African nations could lose lucrative export markets in Europe if they cannot certify that their crops are GM-free. Aid Mr Morris announced the policy reversal after talks in Harare with Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe. &quot;The fact that they have now concluded that they are comfortable in accepting GM crops or commodities will be an important signal to other countries in the region,&quot; Mr Morris told journalists. &quot;It will enable us to do our job,&quot; he said. Aid workers say up to 13 million people in seven countries in Southern Africa face famine. In Zimbabwe which was once the bread basket of the region, some six million people are estimated to need food aid. The WFP says it already has aid pledges for about half of the 600,000 tonnes of food it intends to bring into Zimbabwe in the next few months. The government blames the shortages solely on drought, but the government&#x27;s campaign to transfer land from large scale commercial white farmers has worsened the situation, say many donors. Lost markets The GM row has complicated relief efforts across the region. Zambia&#x27;s president is refusing to overturn his ban on GM food aid, labelling it as &#x27;poison&#x27; . Deals to mill GM food before being distributed, so that it could not be planted, have placated fears in Malawi and Mozambique. United States aid officials deny that the food is unsafe, pointing out that Americans eat GM maize every day. The World Health Organisation has certified the grain for human consumption and says it does not constitute a danger to people&#x27;s health.------------------------ Yahoo!

"[Guido, on the classifier pickle on SF] &gt; I downloaded and played with it a bit, but had no time to do anything &gt; systematic.Cool!&gt; It correctly recognized a spam that slipped through SA.Ditto.&gt; But it also identified as spam everything in my inbox that had any &gt; MIME structure or HTML parts, and several messages in my saved &#x27;zope &gt; geeks&#x27; list that happened to be using MIME and/or HTML.Do you know why?  The strangest implied claim there is that it hates MIME independent of HTML.  For example, the spamprob of &#x27;content-type:text/plain&#x27; in that pickle is under 0.21.  &#x27;content-type:multipart/alternative&#x27; gets 0.93, but that&#x27;s not a killer clue, and one bit of good content will more than cancel it out.WRT hating HTML, possibilities include:1. It really had to do with something other than MIME/HTML.2. These are pure HTML (not multipart/alternative with a text/plain part),    so that the tags aren&#x27;t getting stripped.  The pickled classifier    despises all hints of HTML due to its c.l.py heritage.3. These are multipart/alternative with a text/plain part, but the    latter doesn&#x27;t contain the same text as the text/html part (for    example, as Anthony reported, perhaps the text/plain part just    says something like &quot;This is an HMTL message.&quot;).If it&#x27;s #2, it would be easy to add an optional bool argument to tokenize() meaning &quot;even if it is pure HTML, strip the tags anyway&quot;.  In fact, I&#x27;d like to do that and default it to True.  The extreme hatred of HTML on tech lists strikes me as, umm, extreme .&gt; So I guess I&#x27;ll have to retrain it (yes, you told me so :-).That would be a different experiment.  I&#x27;m certainly curious to see whether Jeremy&#x27;s much-worse-than-mine error rates are typical or aberrant.",0

"Gordon Mohr quoted: &gt;# French Writer Tried As Anti-Islam, Protest Erupts &gt;# By Caroline Brothers &gt;# &gt;# PARIS (Reuters) - Provocative French novelist Michel Houellebecq &gt;# faced a Paris court on Tuesday for allegedly inciting racial hatred &gt;# by calling Islam &quot;the stupidest religion&quot; and its holy book the &gt;# Koran a depressing read. &gt;# &gt;# The case, brought against him by four Muslim groups, is a cause &gt;# celebre reminiscent of the Salman Rushdie affair, pitting freedom of &gt;# expression against religious sensitivities.Very reminiscent indeed.  Ayatollah Chirac has decreed a death sentence on Houellebecq and liked-minded fundamentalists have offered millions of euros bounty for his head, so he has gone into hiding under police protection for a few years.Or maybe some handful of Muslims are acting uppity and dragging him to court under &quot;hate speech&quot; laws make a point about people not showin&#x27; dem da massive respect dat dey deserve, especially these days.Or maybe some journo is trying to fill column inches on a boring day. BTW I read Houellebecq&#x27;s &quot;Extension du domaine de la lutte&quot; recently, about a depressed computer services dude working in Paris, looking for love and not finding it, slowing losing his marbles and trying to get a friend of his to kill a woman, and ending up in a clinic for nutcases...  Yikes!  Purposely provocative, very depressing, with some unbelievably boring passages where the anti-hero writes little stories about animals talking philosophical mumbo-jumbo to each other, quoted inline in full for pages on end.It starts out:&quot;On Friday evening, I was invited to a party with some colleagues from work.  There were about thrity of us, all professionals aged from twenty-five to forty.  At one point, some cunt started getting undressed. She took off her T-shirt, then her bra, then her skirt, all the while making unbelievable faces.  She pranced around for a few seconds, then she started getting dresesd again because she didn&#x27;t know what else to do.  Anyway she never sleeps with anyone.  Which underlines the absurdity of her behaviour.After my fourth glass of vodka I started to feel pretty bad so I had to go lie down on a bunch of cushions behind the couch.  Shortly after that, two girls came and sat on the couch.  Those girls are not pretty at all, the two fat office cows actually.  They go to eat together and read books about the development of language in children, all that sort of stuff.&quot;... and it&#x27;s downhill from there! R ",0

"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85513616 Date: Not suppliedThe new ish of Strange Horizons in out, with an interview with Bloodhag, the  most metal of the all the science fiction metal bands.     Soon, the spotlight comes up again. The lead singer grabs the microphone.      &quot;This is Frank Bellknap Long!&quot; he yells, and, feverish, launches into a      lecture on Long&#x27;s oeuvre. There can&#x27;t be more than a handful of people on      this earth who could get a beer-sodden thrash crowd to listen to an English      Lit lecture. Thirty seconds later, the audience is sufficiently educated,      and the guys begin to wail. Jake the singer holds the microphone over his      head and belts out the song in a growling voice that&#x27;s monster-movie low.      &quot;No reason! No corners!&quot; he shouts. Two minutes later, they&#x27;re done with      the pulps and ready to move on to the New Wave. &quot;Our next song is about      Harlan Ellison!&quot; Jake bellows, and the geeks, the hipsters, the metalheads,      and the drunks let out a howl of mutual joy.     Blï¿½ï¿½dhag -- note the dual umlauts -- hails from Seattle. Describing      themselves as &quot;edu-core,&quot; the band performs nothing but two-minute thrash      tributes to science fiction writers. Between songs, the band pelts the      audience with paperback books, quizzes them on book titles, and demands      that the audience show their library cards. Their motto: &quot;The Faster You Go      Deaf, the More Time You Have to Read.&quot;  Link[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Zed[3]!_)[1] http://www.strangehorizons.com/2002/20020930/bloodhag.shtml [2] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/kfFeZdnp8NE [3] http://www.mememachinego.com/ ",0

My story remains the same, take &gt; &gt; it or leave it. I&#x27;ve said the same words to white supremacists as to &gt; &gt; suburban leftist punks as to homeys as to French Irish, etc. etc.: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#x27;t have to agree with anything you say. I *am* obligated to &gt; &gt; defend to the death your right to say it. I don&#x27;t give a rat&#x27;s ass &gt; &gt; where you say it, even in France. I don&#x27;t care where the political &gt; &gt; pendulum has swung currently. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chuck &gt; &gt; &gt; I had to laugh at Rumsfield yesterday - when he was heckled by &gt; protestors, he said something like &quot;They couldn&#x27;t do that in Iraq.&quot; &gt; Meanwhile, from what I could tell, the protestors were being arrested. &gt; &gt; OwenTrying to shoutdown a speaker or being loud and rowdy while someone else is trying to speak (in the vernacular, &#x27;getting in their face&#x27;) is rude and disrespectful.  And persistently getting in someones face is assault, a criminal offense. If these people have something to say, they can say it with signs or get their own venue.  And here is something else to chew on... these protesters are NOT interested in changing anyones mind about what Rumsfield is saying. How likely are you to change someone&#x27;s mind by being rude and disrespectful to them? Is this how to win friends and influence people? Either these folks are social misfits who have no understanding of human interactions (else they would try more constructive means to get their message across) or they are just out to get their rocks off regardless of how it affects other people, and that is immoral at best and downright evil at worst.Bill ",0

I don&#x27;t say that lightly. This evening he posted a note [1] on his weblog that he was giving up trying to get RDF to make sense inside  RSS. As I read his essay I could feel two-plus years of exhaustion overwhelm  me. I found myself writing a comment after his essay saying, among other things  &quot;RSS is not a brilliant format. It is a compromise. It is for syndicating news  feeds. That&#x27;s all it is for, for the 18,000th time.&quot; It&#x27;s time for RDF to pack  its bags and leave. RSS deserves some dignity, as does RDF. Emphatically, once  and for all, they are not the same thing. Peace be with you RDF. Leave RSS  alone.

"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/showbiz/2308581.stmTuesday, 8 October, 2002, 07:55 GMT 08:55 UK Lennon killer seeks parole againThe man who shot dead former Beatle John Lennon is making another bid for early release from prison - the day before what would have been Lennon&#x27;s 62nd birthday. Mark David Chapman, 47, was jailed for life after he admitted killing the superstar outside his New York apartment building in 1980. It is the second time in two years that Chapman has sought parole from Attica state prison. At a 2000 hearing, he argued that he was no longer a danger to society and had overcome the psychological problems which led him to shoot the ex-Beatle. Chapman had said that a voice in his head told him to shoot the star. Shot dead Lennon was shot four times as he emerged from a limousine outside his New York City apartment on 8 December 1980. He and his wife Yoko Ono were returning from a late-night recording session during which time they had been working on Walking on Thin Ice. Only hours before the shooting, Chapman - who had come to New York from Hawaii - was photographed with the singer outside the same building as Lennon signed a copy of his album Double Fantasy for him. The killer said Lennon had been just &quot;a picture on an album cover&quot; to him before the shooting. &#x27;Deserved death&#x27; Chapman has said that he should have received the death penalty for his crime. Lennon&#x27;s widow told the 2000 parole hearing that she would not feel safe if Chapman were released. Lennon&#x27;s songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney propelled the Liverpool-based pop group to international stardom and unparalleled commercial success. The Beatles front man, peace campaigner, and all-round iconoclast, would have been 62 on Wednesday.------------------------ Yahoo!

"Mr. FoRK writes: &gt; &quot;Files can be cached on multiple systems randomly scattered around the &gt; Internet, as with Napster or Freenet. In fact, the caching in XDegrees is &gt; more sophisticated than it is on those systems: users with high bandwidth &gt; connections can download portions, or &quot;stripes,&quot; of a file from several &gt; cached locations simultaneously. The XDegrees software then reassembles &gt; these stripes into the whole file and uses digital signatures to verify that &gt; the downloaded file is the same as the original. A key component of this &gt; digital signature is a digest of the file, which is stored as an HTTP header &gt; for the file.&quot;This &quot;more sophisticated than [Napster or Freenet]&quot; part seems to be the same behavior implemented in many other P2P CDNs,  such as:  - Kazaa   - EDonkey/Overnet   - BitTorrent   - Gnutella (with HUGE extensions)   - OnionNetworks WebRAID...though the quality of the &quot;digest&quot; used by each system varies wildly.- Gordon",0

Is it possible to get &gt;&gt; some sort of low- &gt;&gt; end internal tape / other solution that could be used to back up &gt;&gt; approx. 40 &gt;&gt; Gigs of data or am I just dreaming? My ISP does offer backups at extra &gt;&gt; cost &gt;&gt; but the only problem with that is, well, the extra cost. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; What I was hoping to do was to install some kind of internal tape &gt;&gt; device, then swap tapes round every month, so I had an onsite backup &gt;&gt; of say the last 24 hours and an offsite backup of the last month. Is &gt;&gt; this feasible? I&#x27;m beginning to think it isn&#x27;t. External devices are &gt;&gt; not an option as part &gt;&gt; of the charge for colocation is rackspace. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks, &gt;&gt; Ciaran. &gt; &gt; I&#x27;d recommend a good external DLT drive. &gt; You will probably need a SCSI card for that too.Yeah, so would I, but as I said, external ain&#x27;t really an option./Ciaran.&gt; &gt; Mmmm. &gt; &gt; -- &gt; Irish Linux Users&#x27; Group: ilug@linux.ie &gt; http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription &gt; information.

"[Skip Montanaro] &gt; Any thought to wrapping up your spam and ham test sets for &gt; inclusion w/ the spambayes project?I gave it all the thought it deserved .  It would be wonderful to get several people cranking on the same test data, and I&#x27;m all in favor of that. OTOH, my Data/ subtree currently has more than 35,000 files slobbering over 134 million bytes -- even if I had a place to put that much stuff, I&#x27;m not sure my ISP would let me email it in one msg .Apart from that, there was a mistake very early on whose outcome was that this isn&#x27;t the data I hoped I was using.  I *hoped* I was using a snapshot of only recent msgs (to match the snapshot this way of only spam from 2002), but turns out they actually go back to the last millennium.  Greg Ward is currently capturing a stream coming into python.org, and I hope we can get a more modern, and cleaner, test set out of that.  But if that stream contains any private email, it may not be ethically possible to make that available. Can you think of anyplace to get a large, shareable ham sample apart from a public mailing list?  Everyone&#x27;s eager to share their spam, but spam is so much alike in so many ways that&#x27;s the easy half of the data collection problem.",0

"re : tax reserve on allegheny peakers the reserve referred to relates to sales and use tax ( &quot; sales / use tax &quot; ) liability related to the purchase and use by the peaker project companies of various equipment ( i . e . , turbines in illinois and transformers in tennessee and indiana ) used to construct the peaker facilities in illinois , indiana and tennessee . enron bears this tax obligation under the sales agreement pursuant to which we sold the peakers to allegheny ( effectively , this tax liability is a &quot; pre - acquisition date &quot; tax liability that we , as the seller , are responsible for ) . typically , the equipment used to construct the peakers would be assessed sales / use tax when purchased by the project company that built the respective peaker and that tax would effectively be passed on to the buyer in a sale such as that to allegheny . the ews tax department structured the acquisition of the respective equipment to either avoid the sales / use tax or to spread the cost of such tax over time ( for example , a sales - leaseback strategy was employed in illinois to spread the cost of the sales / use tax over many years as lease payments are made rather than pay it up front ) . ultimately , we benefitted from this since we did not use as much cash in constructing the peakers and earned more from the disposition of the peakers than we otherwise would have since the counterparty would have ( and we believe did in the specific case of allegheny ) modelled the cost of the peakers as including the full current payment of such sales / use tax . that said , we have requested that a portion of the disposition proceeds from the sale of the peakers be reserved until the applicable statute of limitations related to the types of strategies that were employed to achieve the above described results expires since there is risk that our position could be challenged and , if challenged , there is a risk that we would not prevail . matt is out until may 8 ( he is a recent father of a baby girl ) but upon his return is available with me to discuss this matter with whomever you would like . matt has worked closely with don and others in the generation asset group and has assured me that the suggested reserve is a sound ( not overly conservative nor liberal ) position . best regards . steve . - - - - - original message - - - - - from : kitchen , louise sent : monday , april 30 , 2001 3 : 18 pm to : matthew f gockerman / hou / ect @ enron cc : stephen h douglas / hou / ect @ enron ; don miller / hou / ect @ enron subject : tax reserve on allegheny peakers i notice that our gain has substantially decreased due to a tax reserve increase of $ 5 m . why has this been added and why so recently ? regards louise",0

"credit support value for mg and paperco find below a spreadsheet with my very rough calculation of the value of credit support for mg and paperco . my approach is as follows : 1 . assume all contracts can be modelled as financial swaps . 2 . spread the notional trading volumes over the estimated swap tenors . 3 . calculate the value of defaulting at each period of the swap ( the default option ) using black &#x27; s formula . 4 . treat the value of the default options as risky cash flows . that is treat this value just like you would an annuity stream . by discounting back this stream of cash flows at the original risky rate and at the risk - reduced rate , i find the value of credit enhancement as the difference in the two npv &#x27; s . please give your comments , especially if this makes no sense to you . stinson",0

"On Fri, 19 Jul 2002, Justin Mason mused: &gt; Shane Williams said: &gt;&gt; Also, if a single line of yelling scores -0.036, why not just round &gt;&gt; it off to 0 and not have the test run at all? &gt;  &gt; good question ;)It seems reasonable to have a configurable minimum below which spamassassin flattens the test to zero (turning it off): by default set to zero; but if you set it to say 0.01, spamassassin would ignore tests with scores -0.01&lt;0&lt;0.01 (trading accuracy for time).The overkill variant of this feature would have scores scored by (score * relative-time-taken) with relative-time-taken computed over a large corpus (probably Craig&#x27;s ;} ). Then you could specify a minimum value of *that* parameter to flatten at, giving assurances that you&#x27;re killing only tests that are expensive for their utility.Unfortunately I can&#x27;t think of a good name for that parameter.I can whip up a patch if anyone thinks this is any use.--  `There&#x27;s something satisfying about killing JWZ over and over again.&#x27;                                         -- 1i, personal communication ",0

"re : 6 . 381 words that are their own opposites several people submitted &quot; overlook &quot; and &quot; oversight &quot; , which are fine examples of this phenomenon in english ( though i think that mary neff &#x27;s &quot; outgoing : retiring &quot; is perhaps the most elegant submission to date . ) perhaps my current work on the various shades of meaning in english prepositions has biased me , but in any case i think that the difference in the various senses of &quot; oversight &quot; and &quot; overlook &quot; stems largely from their compounding with &quot; over - &quot; . &quot; over &quot; is sneaky ; at first glance it seems to be fairly limited in expressive power , but deeper analysis reveals that in it lurk a number of distinctions of meaning , some of them quite subtle indeed . in addition to nuances of physical location , &quot; over &quot; can indicate power relationships ( both outright force , and more subtle authority ) , value judgements , and the general notion of ( metaphorically ) moving on to another thing , as in &quot; get over it &quot; and &quot; skip over &quot; . so my analysis of &quot; oversight &quot; and &quot; overlook &quot; would be that in one sense , &quot; over &quot; takes on the meaning of authority-over , and in the other sense it takes on the meaning of skipping-over . perhaps a similar argument could be make for the &quot; sight / see / look &quot; part of the compound ? for instance , useages such as &quot; see to it &quot; &quot; look to your own interest &quot; seem to carry some of this &quot; authority &quot; meaning . i think the &quot; over &quot; analysis is more clear-cut , but it would be interesting to see if someone will make a case for the other half . - - marion kee marion kee | all opinions are my own ; knowledge engineer , center for machine translation | when cmu wants my opinions carnegie mellon university pittsburgh , pa , usa | it pays for them .",0

" Gary Lawrence Murphy said:&gt; I envy some of those posting to this list.  I&#x27;ve been in business for &gt; 24 years and I haven&#x27;t yet had the luxury of writing every line of &gt; code for any project. We are always coerced by budgets and time to &gt; maximize the amount of work done elsewhere.  For consultancy, integration or open source work, sure, perl, python or java with free use of external libs makes a lot of sense IMO.I should note that normally when I&#x27;ve used C or C++ in the past, it&#x27;s dictated by the fact that I would be working on a commercial product, written from the ground up, where the code you&#x27;re generating is important IP for the company; in this case, using a third-party lib often is not an option, or would be a PITA licensing-wise.Also, cutting out third-party dependencies can reduce the risk of &quot;oops, there goes the company that makes that library I depend on, now to shop around for something vaguely similar, figure out what bugs it&#x27;s got, rewrite my code to use the new API, and hope for the best&quot;.This can be a *very* big deal, for obvious reasons ;)    Open source knockers should note that this is not a problem when using LGPL&#x27;d libs ;)--j.",0

"I think that when considering deployment, a solution that supports all Python platforms and not just the L|Unix crowd is desirable.Mac and PC users are more apt to be using a commercial MUA that&#x27;s unlikely to offer hooking ability (at least not easily). As mentioned elsewhere, even L|Unix users may find an MUA solution easier to use then getting it added to their MTA. (SysOps make programmers look like flaming liberals ;).)My notion of a solution for Windows/Outlook has been, as Guido described, a client-server. Client side does pop3/imap/mapi fetching (of which, I&#x27;m only going to implement pop3 initially) potentially on several hosts, spamhams the incoming mail and puts it into one file per message (qmail style?). The MUA accesses this &quot;eThunk&quot; as a server to obtain all the ham. Spam is retained in the eThunk and a simple viewer would be used for manual oversight on the spam for ultimate rejection (and training of spam filter) and the ham will go forward (after being used for training) on the next MUA fetch. eThunk would sit on a timer for &#x27;always online&#x27; users, but I am not clear on how to support dialup users with this scheme.Outbound mail would use a direct path from the MUA to the MTA. Hopefully all MUAs can split the host fetch/send URL&#x27;sIMO, end users are likely to be more intested in n-way classification. If this is available, the &quot;simple viewer&quot; could be enhanced to support viewing via folders and (at least for me) the Outlook nightmare is over - I would use this as my only MUA. (N.B. according to my recent readings, the best n-way classifier uses something called a &quot;Support Vector Machine&quot; (SVM) which is 5-8% more accurate then Naive Bayes (NB) ).I wonder if the focus of spambayes ought not to be a classifier that leaves the fetching and feeding of messages to auxillary code? That way, it could be dropped into whatever harness that suited the user&#x27;s situation.David LeBlanc Seattle, WA USA ",0

Providing end-to-end security, the XDegrees System unifies authentication of all users, provides file-level access control and encrypts all stored and transferred files. Seamless integration with existing applications such as email clients and Microsoft Office products allows companies to rapidly deploy the XDegrees System and users to get up-and-running quickly.&quot;Whoa... high tech...=== More bits here... http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2001/04/27/xdegrees.html&quot;The essence of XDegrees consists of a naming system and a distributed database that allows peers to resolve resource names. XDegrees manages these services for customers on its own hosts, and sells its software to enterprises so they can define and run their own namespaces on in-house servers. You can search for a particular person (whatever device the person is currently using), for a particular device, for a file, or even for a web service.

"re : 5 . 1237 sum : basic word order ( and remarks on typology ) fritz newmeyer raises some important issues about typological research as instantiated in nichols &#x27; work and elsewhere , which call for some comments . first , the notion of language type is an idealization : this is often made clear in typology courses , where non-existent artificial languages are considered as logically possible or impossible language types , if not always in the published literature ( though the point is clearly made in comrie &#x27;s textbook , for example , by the discussion of morphological typology ) . similarly , fritz is quite right to point out that the assumption of no areal or genetic bias , to the extent that it is made at all , is a counterfactual one . what i would ask is whether such idealizations differ in kind from those , many of them counterfactual , which underlie generative grammar . the justification is similar in both cases : methodologically , one cannot deal with all the relevant variables all the time , and some of the concepts used are logically independent of the extrinsic variables , e . g . one can investigate consistency with proposed implicational universals regardless of the statistical bias in one &#x27;s sample . the term ` shaky typological pigeon-holing &#x27; is particularly inapt as applied to nichols &#x27; distinction between head-marking and dependent - marking languages , which is quite explicitly a matter of degree ( see her 1986 paper where the degree of hm vs . dm is quantifified in terms of the number of patterns instantiating each type ) . if nichols refers to a ` head-marking language &#x27; this is shorthand for a quantifiable tendency , just as we might describe italian as a ` pro-drop language &#x27; without implying that there is a binary distinction here ( in fact there are degrees of pro-drop , e . g . some languages allow null expletives but not null referential subjects , etc ) . another point which i think all typologists would accept is that languages which do n&#x27;t appear to match an established type are typological data - for example , colloquial french as discussed recently on linguist is a language which might reasonably be described as having no basic word order ( i believe that nichols classified it as vso in one of her tables , but that is again shorthand for a more complex situation ) . this is an explanandum for which nichols &#x27; 1986 paper offers an explanation : head-marking facilitates word order freedom , and colloquial french instantiates clausal head-marking in nichols &#x27; sense . to sum up : pace widespread opinion , typologists &#x27; goal is not pigeon-holing ( &quot; taxonomy &quot; is also widely used in this context ! ) but the investigation and explanation of patterns of variation . steve matthews",0

"all, I posted the below question to this list so I thought I&#x27;d update you all. Thanks for your suggestions.Well, I&#x27;d decided to bite the bullet and spend big on a new case and CPU fan.I bought a lian-li aluminum case. It was expensive as cases go (stgÂ£133.86) but I decided, it&#x27;s a good basis to build any future PC on. It has 4 x 51/4&quot; drive bays and 6 x 3Â½&quot; drive bays so I should be ok for future upgrades etc. I have to say it was worth it. Its a pleasure to work on. It has a slide out tray to mount the Mother Board on, both sides come off, the drive bays come out...all without using a screwdriver (thumb screws). Even the edges inside the case are smooth so no banging your hands off shape edges etc. There are 4 fans inside the case, which can be set to 3 different speeds. There are 4 usb ports on the front of the box too. The box is big and has loads of room inside. Oh... and it looks very cool :-)However there are 2 things to look out for. On the Maplins website it says* Up to three 80mm case fans can be fitted! * ATX Power supply sold separatelyIn fact the case came with 4 fans and a power supply, which is great but I ordered 2 fans and a power supply separately. Also the case was a slightly different model to one advertised, as I got the USB model. It does say (Product may vary in design and specification from that show) but I missed that :-)I also bought a Flower Cooler Kit which is completely silent. Very nice. (thanks Mike)So now I can code-in-peace...Justin &gt; -----Original Message----- &gt; From: ilug-admin@linux.ie [mailto:ilug-admin@linux.ie]On Behalf Of &gt; Justin MacCarthy &gt; Sent: Monday, August 12, 2002 12:56 PM &gt; To: Ilug@Linux.Ie &gt; Subject: [ILUG] PC Cases &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all, I have a Linux box at home that makes a god awful amount of noise. &gt; Its a Athlon XP 1900+ with a CoolerMaster fan. Are they particularly &gt; noisy? I think its the case/psu fan. It was a pretty cheap case. So what &gt; I&#x27;m looking for a quieter case/fan/power supply. I know you can get really &gt; quiet cases if you want to spend, but I&#x27;m looking for something in the &gt; middle ground, available in Dublin. &gt; &gt; Anyone recommend anything ?

"URL: http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000637 Date: 2002-10-05T21:15:55-06:00I guess it&#x27;s time to reveal the incredibly kind invitation I received[1]. As  many of you may have found out or guessed, I will be attending oral argument  for the Eldred case[2] before the Supreme Court. I&#x27;m incredibly excited, as you might imagine. Visiting the Supreme Court would  be quite enough, but seeing such an important case...Dayenu! When Lessig asked  me if I was free that day to come, I laughed because I couldn&#x27;t (and still  can&#x27;t) think of anything I&#x27;d rather do than attend. I am eternally grateful to  Lessig for the chance to attend. On the other hand, I&#x27;m sort of embarassed to  have the opportunity, when there are surely others who deserve it far more than  me. Luckily, it seems that such deserving others will be able to get seats by  camping in line with us. So, I&#x27;ll be arriving in D.C. on Tuesday, attending an  Eldred/Duke/EPIC/Bookmobile superparty, and then camping in line with Seth  Schoen[3], Lisa Rein, Jace Cooke but unfortunately not Cory Doctorow. If you&#x27;d  like to come with us, let me know. I was hoping I&#x27;d be able to take notes and post them to my weblog for those who  couldn&#x27;t make it, but as I read in today&#x27;s Times, only lawyers and those with  official press credentials are allowed to take notes![4] I think this is  outrageous, but hopefully I will be able to remember enough to provide an  interesting account. In a related irony, today was &quot;Disney Day&quot; at Borders[5], where they played  Disney rock songs with the volume turned up too loud, disturbing my usual habit  of reading a book there. However, I did manage to skim through _The Practice of  Programming_. In an unrelated note, if you haven&#x27;t been electrocuted by a Model T spark plug,  I highly recommend it.[1] http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000609 [2] http://eldred.cc/ [3] http://vitanuova.loyalty.org/2002-10-02.html [4] http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/05/opinion/05AMAR.html [5] http://www.bordersstores.com/events/event_detail.jsp?SEID=15127444 ",0

el paso as we have moved into the shoulder months of september and october we need to be aware that the el paso load curve is shifting . this means you will slowly start seeing a greater morning ramp than in the past few months . we need to keep this in mind and utilize the dispatch and load curves supplied to us by el paso to ensure a smooth morning ramp . for the past two days the night shift has oversold for he 6 to the point of having to turn on the steamers both days . there is no reason that we shold be selling he 6 and turning on the steamers at the same time . be very careful not to oversell for he 6 . if you have any questions about load curves feel free to talk with bill or a senior member of the group . cheers - - - guz,0

This &gt; feature can easily be copied into hammie.py.That&#x27;s been done now, right?&gt; (GBayes.py also has a large collection of tokenizers; but timtoken.py &gt; rules, so I&#x27;m not sure how interesting that is now.)Those tokenizers are truly trivial to rewrite from scratch if they&#x27;re interesting.  The tiny spam/ham collections in GBayes are also worthless now.

While mailing lists can be spam/worm amplifiers, I don&#x27;t think this is true for individual users even today. Moreover, worms which use email as vector exist *only* because a single vendor ships mailers with broken default settings, and insists to make documents executables. This makes for very bad press, and eventually that vendor is going to wise up, and  stop shipping as many broken wares (or people will switch to more secure  alternatives, whatever comes first).http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork ",0

"&gt; From: Owen Byrne  &gt; A flippant remark that I will probably regret  - &gt; sure there&#x27;s assholes everywhere. I just remember a lunch in Spain with &gt; a semi-famous American - I think we had about 10 nationalities at the &gt; table, and he managed to insult each of them within &gt; 15 minutes. A historical perspective makes me think that empires - &gt; Roman, British, Russian, American, whatever - produce &gt;  a larger proportion of assholes than subject nations (and are more &gt; likely to have them in positions of authority).Yep, those that win battles collect tthe spoils.  Lead and breed.  Want it to be different?  Lead, don&#x27;t whine. ",0

"Rohit Khare wrote: &gt;  &gt; Why am I so passionate about decentralization? Because I believe some of &gt; today?s most profound problems with networked applications are caused by &gt; centralization. &gt;  &gt; Generically, a centralized political or economic system permits only one &gt; answer to a question, while decentralization permits many separate &gt; agents to hold different opinions of the same matter. In the specific &gt; context of software, centralized variables can only contain one valid &gt; value at a time. That limits us to only representing information A) &gt; according to the beliefs of a single agency, and B) that changes more &gt; slowly than it takes to propagate. Nevertheless, centralization is the &gt; basis for today?s most popular architectural style for developing &gt; network applications: client-server interaction using request-response &gt; communication protocols.I think the ability to maintain an inconsistent database is key to decentralization. Databases enforce consistenty with every transaction. Bounded transactions, like an ATM, enforce consistency   by have some play with time and value Most people keep inconsistent data in their heads, it&#x27;s   called congnitive dissonance theory Most businesses keep inconsistent data, documents, tationale   and ideas to support their work activities, it&#x27;s called real life.I don&#x27;t think it matters so much where it&#x27;s located, i.e. decentralization. I think that decentralization is the workaround from technical limitations.  The fallout being that the only way inconsistent information spaces can be maintained is by  protecting them through a set of trust barriers and boundaries.  The local information when combined with the technical troubles of providing &quot;just enough&quot; forced synchronization to remote information provide workable data consistenty, i.e. enforcing local constraints or ignoring global ones when concerns are more immedidate.  Tolerating temporary, irreconcilable deviations is how people cope, otherwise you&#x27;d be like Nick Gatsby unnecessarily pre-occupied with a spot of shaving cream on McKee&#x27;s neck who thinks that if he can just wipe that spot off that the whole world would be a little more perfect and everything, including his pre-occupation with Daisy, would consistently be in its proper place.Greg ",0

"On Sun, 1 Sep 2002, Bill Stoddard wrote:&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Red Hat Linux Advanced Server provides many high end features such as: &gt; &gt; Support for Asynchronous I/O. Now read I/O no longer needs to stall your &gt; &gt; application while waiting for completion.&quot; &gt; &gt; Can you provide a reference?  I could find it myself but I&#x27;m too lazy.Well, i saw it on the Compaq Testdrive site, then had to seriously dig on the redhat site... It&#x27;s in one of their whitepapers... http://www.redhat.com/pdf/as/as_rasm.pdf &gt; &gt; Could it be? After 20 years without this feature UNIX finally &gt; &gt; catches up to &gt; &gt; Windows and has I/O that doesnt totally suck for nontrivial apps? No way! &gt; &gt; Do /dev/poll and FreeBSD&#x27;s KQ event driven APIs count? IMHO, true async &gt; io as implemented by Windows 4.0 and beyond is pretty slick, but the &gt; programming model is substantially more complex than programming to an &gt; event API like /dev/poll. And true async does not buy much if the &gt; system call overhead is low (as it is with Linux).I havent used the FBSD poll, as it&#x27;s not portable, select and poll(still not 100%) are all that exist in the UNIX world. Redhat of course doesnt count as portable either, but it&#x27;s nice they are trying. The Windows I/O model does definately blow the doors off the UNIX one, but then they had select to point at in it&#x27;s suckiness and anything would have been an improvement. UNIX is just now looking at it&#x27;s I/O model and adapting to a multiprocess multithreaded world so it&#x27;s gonna be years yet before a posix API comes out of it. Bottom line is the &quot;do stuff when something happens&quot; model turned out to be right, and the UNIX &quot;look for something to do and keep looking till you find it no matter how many times you have to look&quot; is not really working so great anymore.- Adam L. &quot;Duncan&quot; Beberg   http://www.mithral.com/~beberg/   beberg@mithral.com ",0

"proj . x analytics diligence paul , vince and i spent some time thinking about the diligence process for the trading analytics . there is a limited amount that can be accomplished in a two day time period . i think a reasonable start would be the following : 1 . obtain an audited history of the trading strategies which have been implemented in order to verify profitability , and p / l volatility of each . 2 . review needed working capital and risk capital requirements and compare these to projections for trading income . 3 . review current level of access to electronic markets and verify that a change of ownership would not have adverse consequences , i . e . are there guarantees of continued access using the current systems ? 4 . review feasibility of entry into proposed new markets ? it is far from clear that there will be any synergy with most commodity markets given the current limited &quot; electronic &quot; liquidity . 5 . review , at least qualitatively , the current trading strategies being used . try to develop some estimate of how fast the profitability of these strategies will disappear as other &#x27; s implement similar trading models . what is the trade off between trade quantity and slippage . 6 . review the methodology used to generate new trading strategies which will be needed to replace the current models as they become unprofitable and outdated . 7 . try to determine if there will be any value in transfer of trading technology to enron &#x27; s other markets , given the illiquidity of these markets as compared to the financial equity markets . if there were a sufficiently long time horizon for our analysis , we would probably want to run their system on a test set of data . let me know if you have other suggestions . - - stinson",0

"Bill Stoddard wrote:&gt;&gt;GAB&gt; The problem is that politics have gotten so muddied &gt;&gt;GAB&gt; nowadays, that shouting down and unpeaceably disrupting &gt;&gt;GAB&gt; political rallies that you don&#x27;t agree with has become &gt;&gt;GAB&gt; common practice.  The courts have constantly ruled &gt;&gt;GAB&gt; that there are some restrictions on the first amendment. &gt;&gt;GAB&gt; They teach you that your very first year of law school. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;I&#x27;ll agree with Owen on this one.  Muddied my ass.  How hard is it to &gt;&gt;chose between a Republocrat or a Demipublican?   Not very.  Shouting &gt;&gt;down has grown to become the answer because the government, over a &gt;&gt;span of years, and with the help of the Courts -has- limited the &gt;&gt;rights we have as citizens under the First Amendment. &gt;&gt;     &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;Wishful thinking. People are just bigger dickheads now. Culture is changing &gt;and it is becoming acceptable to get in peoples face and shout them down &gt;when you disagree with them.  The people that do this are NOT &gt;disenfranchised. They &gt;get their rocks off on being disagreeable assholes. The act of protesting is &gt;more important than the actual issue being protested for most of these &gt;people. &gt;   &gt; In my experience, this is classic &quot;American&quot; behaviour, and I don&#x27;t  think its on the increase outside of the US of A. I am willing to accept the premise that Americans are bigger dickheads  then they used to be.Owen",0

" wintermute  a Ã©crit: &gt; &gt; I&#x27;m confused. I thought it was GPL&#x27;ed and &gt; &gt; that the money you paid SuSE was for your &gt; &gt; 60 day support or whatever?   &gt; No, as of oh, about a year to a year and a half ago &gt; SuSE revoked it&#x27;s free offering of it&#x27;s retail &gt; distro.&gt; Sometime about the start of the great slump, SuSE &gt; pulled free release of it&#x27;s main x86 product. Fine - nobody can oblige SuSE to do anything other than put up the ftp version, but surely they can&#x27;t prevent a CD owner from burning a copy and giving it to me?What is the GPL all about then?&gt; I&#x27;m not sure on the details of it, but I think SuSE &gt; have probably done an OpenBSD of the cd they sell? But *_surely_* they cannot BSD Linux? It&#x27;s not theirs to BSD!  &gt; I could be wrong, I don&#x27;t use SuSE so haven&#x27;t &gt; investigated, but essentially the only &#x27;free&#x27; &gt; version of SuSE will be it&#x27;s tp offering. Nobody can oblige them to give away anything other than ftp - I&#x27;m not asking for that. I&#x27;m asking for somebody who has Linux (GPL&#x27;ed) to burn a copy for me and give it to me in exchange for a reasonable consideration (say, the price of the CDs and a bottle of Frascati or a couple of pints?). What does the GPL mean now? I don&#x27;t want their 60 days of free email support or anything similar (if I did, I would pay for it).

"Jeff--What is the maildrop recipe you use with spamassassin?  I was trying to set mine up but I am running into a few difficulties.I think I will try spamassassin first and see how it goes, and then perhaps fold in razor2... is it easy to fold in?Sunil&gt; &gt; Here is my recipe for Maildrop: &gt; &gt; # Vipul&#x27;s Razor check &gt; # &gt; log `/usr/bin/razor-check` &gt; log &quot;razor-check = $RETURNCODE&quot; &gt; if ( $RETURNCODE == 0 ) &gt; { &gt;   xfilter &quot;reformail -a&#x27;X-Razor: SPAM&#x27;&quot; &gt;   log &quot;SPAM caught by Vipul&#x27;s Razor&quot; &gt;   to &quot;$FOLDERS/.SPAM/&quot; &gt; } &gt; &gt; I used this with Razor version 1.  I&#x27;m not sure if it was ever used with &gt; Razor2.  I am now using SpamAssassin w/ Razor2.  You may wish to remove &gt; the log statements once running. &gt; &gt; I use both.  SpamAssassin (SA) catches things that Razor does not. &gt; There were enough false positives with Razor that I do not trust it &gt; alone.

I was thinking to set up razor with maildrop as my &gt;&gt; first test of its filtering capabilities.. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I have seen documentation out there for procmail, but is there similar &gt;&gt; documentation for integrating maildrop with razor? &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Separately, it looks like many people use spamassassin with razor.  If &gt;&gt; I am using razor2, is there still an advantage to this? &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks in advance. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sunil &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------- &gt; This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek &gt; Welcome to geek heaven. &gt; http://thinkgeek.com/sf &gt; _______________________________________________ &gt; Razor-users mailing list &gt; Razor-users@lists.sourceforge.net &gt; https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/razor-users------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven. http://thinkgeek.com/sf _______________________________________________ Razor-users mailing list Razor-users@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/razor-users ",0

"change of control provisions as many of you know , i have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $ 20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of enron . the merger with dynegy , or a similar transaction with any other company , would trigger this provision on closing . assuming the merger with dynegy is closed within 6 - 9 months , as we expect , this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $ 60 million . many ceos have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989 . but given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees , i have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment . initially , i thought i would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash . however , after talking to a number of employees this afternoon , i have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment . therefore , at closing , i will receive no payments under this provision . i know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face . but please know that i will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of enron &#x27; s employees and shareholders . i am still very proud of what we have built at enron , and i want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore enron to its rightful place in the energy industry . thank you .",0

"Owen Byrne writes: &gt; [quoting http://www.quinion.com/words/qa/qa-shi2.htm] &gt; *SHIVER MY TIMBERS* &gt;  &gt; /From Tad Spencer/: &quot;Please could you tell me where the phrase /shiver  &gt; my timbers/ originated?&quot; &gt;  &gt; This is one of those supposedly nautical expressions that seem to be  &gt; better known through a couple of appearances in fiction than by any  &gt; actual sailors&#x27; usage. &gt;  &gt; It&#x27;s an exclamation that may allude to a ship striking some rock or  &gt; other obstacle so hard that her timbers shiver, or shake, so implying a  &gt; calamity has occurred. It is first recorded as being used by Captain  &gt; Frederick Marryat in /Jacob Faithful/ in 1835: &quot;I won&#x27;t thrash you Tom.  &gt; Shiver my timbers if I do&quot;.It seems implausible to me that &quot;shiver&quot; here means &quot;to shake&quot;; I don&#x27;t recall seeing the word used transitively in that sense, and web1913 lists that sense as &quot;v. i.&quot;, or intransitive.  The transitive sense of &quot;shiver&quot;, which we no longer use but which people used widely in the 1800s (web1913 doesn&#x27;t even list it as archaic or obsolete), means &quot;to shatter into splinters, normally with a blow&quot;.Shivering a boat&#x27;s timbers, of course, leaves you with no boat. (Shivering some of them, which will happen if you hit a rock hard enough, leaves you with a sinking boat.)So, &quot;Shiver my timbers if I do,&quot; can be reasonably interpreted as a more vivid way of saying, &quot;May I die suddenly if I do.&quot;  The interpretation suggested by Quinion, &quot;May my boat be damaged,&quot; neither makes as much sense in context nor obeys the normal rules of grammar.I&#x27;ve sent a copy of this to Quinion.

It currently provides inline virus scanning and ORDB open relay filtering. Is it possible to setup SA to act as a sitewide Spam filter ? Is there any documentation on setting this up ? The Qmail server does not house any local mail accounts, it acts as a pure relay for our internal mail server, I am currently relaing mail for 8 internal domains...Suggestions would be appreciated.Regards Zenn ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven. http://thinkgeek.com/sf _______________________________________________ Spamassassin-talk mailing list Spamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk ",0

"On Thu, Aug 08, 2002 at 08:00:00PM -0700, Jehan  is thought to have said:&gt; Actually you would be inaccurate in your action in a way. The correct  &gt; behavior would be to unsubscribe razor-users@fsckit.net from the mailing  &gt; list.Wow. I think a majority of the anti-spam community out there would disagree with you. It makes no difference what the list is, whether it&#x27;s run by ZDNet or Empire Towers, whether it uses open proxies and relays or a MLM like mailman or Lyris. In either case I was added to a list against my will to  receive unsolicited bulk email. I shouldn&#x27;t have to &#x27;just unsubscribe from the list&#x27; any more than I should have to send email with the subject REMOVE to removemeblahblah1234@yahoo.com or go to http://www.centralremovelist.com/ to &#x27;unsubscribe&#x27; from some viagra spam. Or are you advocating that as well?&gt; But in any case, you have to understand that you and him would not be  &gt; the only one involved. As I said in a another thread, you probably get  &gt; hurt only if you are against the majority of people (which makes sense).  &gt; If you are with the majority, you get a bonus (which also makes sense).  &gt; If there is no majority, nobody wins or lose.That&#x27;s fine. But my point is that neither person in my example was committing an inherently untrustworthy act. Yet someone&#x27;s TES would likely fall because of it.&gt; Razor is designed for the betterment of most people, i.e. the majority,  &gt; not for the individual. If one doesn&#x27;t agree with the majority, he  &gt; should use the razor-whitelist or create a blacklist (BTW, why doesn&#x27;t  &gt; razor provide a razor-blacklist too?)Hmm. Good point about razor-whitelist. I&#x27;d forgotten about that.--  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Tabor J.

That&#x27;s my understanding of how it works anyway. &gt; &gt; John &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [ILUG] Optimizing for Pentium Pt.2That was my understanding too, but I since fould out that for Linux:Most programs and libraries by default are compiled with optimizing level 2 (gcc options -g and -O2) and are compiled for a specific CPU. On Intel platforms software is compiled for i386 processors by default. If you don&#x27;t wish to run software on other machines other than your own, you might want to change the default compiler options so that they will be compiled with a higher optimization level, and generate code for your specific architecture.Therefore: export CFLAGS=&quot;-O3 -march=&quot; &amp;&amp; CXXFLAGS=$CFLAGSThis is a minimal set of optimizations that ensures it works on almost all platforms. The option march will compile the binaries with specific instructions for that CPU you have specified. This means you can&#x27;t copy this binary to a lower class CPU and execute it.So these are the optimizations I need to worry about, and the optimizations that lfs says to disable before compiling GCC or GlibC. However, GlibC seems the most likely candidate for optimization since it provides the libs used by even the most simple programs to access system calls in the kernel.I&#x27;m still waiting for info from the GCC mailing list RE: optimising/patching GCC for performance improvement. So far the only suggestion has been to try using icc, Intels C compiler. It&#x27;s known to work with the kernel, but user apps, and I guess libs and such might need rewriting to compile, and I&#x27;m not prepared to go to this length.For QT and KDE it seems there are also gains to be made with object pre-linking, but there are also risks with this so I&#x27;ll just have to suck it and see. Either way, I&#x27;m going to get started building the base today. I&#x27;m still waiting for some DRI patches for my GVX1 card but it&#x27;ll probably been several days before I&#x27;m ready to build X anyway.Cheers, John Gay-- Irish Linux Users&#x27; Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

"&gt; &gt; Is the use of &quot;trusted hardware&quot; really worth it ? &gt; &gt; Answering that requires fairly complete knowledge of the business &gt; model. But, in all probability: no, it isn&#x27;t usually worth it. So, it &gt; comes down to how difficult you want to make the cracker&#x27;s job. &gt; &gt; &gt; Look at the DVDs. &gt; &gt; IIRC, CSS was cracked by reverse-engineering a software player; and &gt; one where the developers forgot to encrypt the decryption key at that.This make me wonder about the relative protection of smart cards.  They have  an internal procession unit around 4MHz.  Can we consider them as trusted  hardware ?  The ability to ship smart cards periodicaly uppon cashing of a  monthly subscription fee would not raise too much the cost of &quot;renting&quot; the  system.  Smart card do their own self encryption.  Can they be used to  decrypt data needed by the system ?  The input of the system could me mangled  and the would keep a reference of how long it was in service.This sounds really feasible but I may be totaly wrong.  I may also be wrong  about the safety of a smart card.  What do you think ?--  Yannick Gingras Coder for OBB : Oceangoing Bared Bonanza http://OpenBeatBox.org ",0

Liberal Party member Barry Haase was &quot;won&quot; in a charity auction  after the madam of Langtree&#x27;s brothel in the mining town of  Kalgoorlie made the highest offer for his services for a day. [...]&quot;I hope he will leave with an informed decision on what  Australian brothels are all about and it will help him in his  political career to make informed decisions that he might not  have been able to make before,&quot; Ms Kenworthy said. Mr Haase, a member of Prime Minister John Howard&#x27;s party  seemed relaxed about the prospect of working in a brothel. &quot;You can&#x27;t be half-hearted about fundraising for significant  charities and I think I&#x27;m big enough to play the game,&quot; he said.

"ft . pierce ozzie : as a follow up to our phone conversation , how about scheduling the ft . pierce project review meeting during the second week in april ? the objective of the meeting is to look at the technical risk in the deal and the mitigation measures we taking . the intended outcome is to ensure all related enron entities are supportive of the transaction and have had the opportunity to ask questions . this will reduce the chance that we will run into objections down the road on &quot; technical risks &quot; as we begin to ramp up our capital commitments . we had a similar meeting with the electrobolt team in enron s . america , that was very productive and accomplished the above objectives . do you have a project presentation that you ( and / or the lead developer ) could discuss with the above team ? as many of the technical risk issues are also tied to commercial aspects of the deal we should also cover these areas as well ( e . g . , commercial objectives and obligations driving the technical design and implementation strategy ) . one of the key aspects of the project to discuss is the schedule risk and our strategy for securing a capable construction contractor for the job . let me know as to your availability , and who else you think should attend the meeting . thanks , brian",0

To me, &gt; it looks like a potential backdoor to anyone&#x27;s defenses against spam. &gt; &gt; If I were a spammer, I&#x27;d simply set up a server, send out my spam with &gt; the Habeus headers and continue till I was reasonably certain I&#x27;d been &gt; reported.

I am also concerned that it was added after the rules freeze, that such a major change was not discussed in advance, etc.There&#x27;s also no evidence that the rule will actually reduce FPs.

"*This message was transferred with a trial version of CommuniGate(tm) Pro* We All Need a Good Attorney to Call in Today&#x27;s Society. Keeping ahead of the legal issues in our life was just simply more than we could bear. We needed legal advice and we needed it right away. Unfortunately, being middle class, put us in the wrong income bracket to have such a necessity. Now all of this has changed. Think about the issues that can suddenly come up in your personal life:Monday: The dog bit the mailman - Do you know what to do? Tuesday:  The Building Inspector drops by and announces that the permits on file with their office do not     allow your garage conversion. &quot;What now,&quot; you think to yourself. Wednesday: You&#x27;ve been considering home-schooling your children for some time. Now your daughter announces that she is being picked on yet again, and simply will not attend another day. What are the legal ramifications of home schooling your children?Â  Thursday: Speeding Ticket goes to warrant for your 17-year-old son. You haven&#x27;t a clue how to handle     it.Â  Friday:  Your ex-spouse has missed another child support payment. . . Who do you call?And what about all the other things:Received a Traffic Ticket You Thought Was Unjustified? Paid a Bill You Knew Was Unfair? Lost a Security Deposit? Bought a Home or Purchased A Car? Signed an Employment Contract? Had difficulty collecting an insurance claim? Had Trouble With Your Credit Report? Been Involved in a Landlord or Property Dispute? Been Involved in a separation or divorce? Had to Collect Child Support? Prepared A Will or Wanted To? In your personal life, you need legal representation available to you all the time. But most of us never have it because we can&#x27;t afford it.Now there is a program that not only provides quality legal help,  but it provides it 24 hours a day, with an attorney helping you the same day you call them -  and it is for a small monthly fee. No Kidding.  Somewhere between twenty and forty dollars a month, depending upon the plan you choose.   Â Click here Â  Not   interested?

" ----- Original Message ----- From: &quot;Gary Lawrence Murphy&quot; &gt; ... and the one thing I think we&#x27;ve learned in all that time is that, &gt; as a help-desk, it doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m not sure they are doing strictly help-desk stuff. But the whole &#x27;who in their right mind would use that? it doesn&#x27;t have all these cool features!&#x27; isn&#x27;t always a guarantee of failure - maybe there is a strength in this approach (agents and/or IM as ui) than can find a nich application space.&gt; &gt; In all the prolog-based NL database query systems of the 1980&#x27;s and &gt; other later chatterbot helpdesk projects like Shallow Red, even &gt; simpler tries like Ask Jeeves, people very quickly know they&#x27;re &gt; talking to a robot, and the queries anneal to short, truncated and &gt; terse database-like verb-noun or just noun-keyword requests. Kind of like a web query - and with google, someone else can turn them into a link so you don&#x27;t even have to type anything.&gt; &gt; People are just too quick to adapt, and too impatient to forgive a &gt; clunky interface, and for now, especially when the /average/ computer &gt; user still can&#x27;t type more than maybe 5-10wpm, NL is a painfully slow &gt; clunky interface. Yes - true true.&gt; &gt; Put it this way: Would you login, wake the bot and ask for the Seattle &gt; weather, or would you do as we /all/ do and just click the weather &gt; icon sitting there on your desktop? What about a situation where you don&#x27;t directly ask/talk to the bot, but they listen in and advise/correct/interject/etc? example: two people discussing trips, etc. may trigger a weather bot to mention what the forecast says - without directly being asked.

"Once upon a time, &quot;&quot;Angles&quot; wrote :&gt; When I went all &quot;Open Source&quot;, I stopped using my old partioning app &gt; (partition magic?). For the RH7 install I used FIPS (a couple times). &gt; Then ext3 came out and my old commercial partioning app is real old, so I &gt; ask what OS software can non-destructively repartition a HD so I can put &gt; /home on a seperate partition now?Parted is your friend! You can&#x27;t do _everything_, the most limiting being that you can&#x27;t move the start of a partition, but it&#x27;s quite powerful nevertheless, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it the few times I&#x27;ve had to use it.&gt; &gt;If you didn&#x27;t put /home on a separate partition, &gt;  &gt; With winbloze 9x I used to deltree the winbloze dir and some &quot;Program &gt; Files&quot; dirs, and install &quot;fresh&quot; instead of upgrade, while saving my &gt; other data. Can this trick be used with this RH8 upgrade? Example rpm -e &gt; everything so all packages are gone, hit &quot;reset&quot; button and boot to &gt; redhat CDROM in admin (rescue?) mode, delete all those config files left, &gt; like &quot;/etc/*&quot;, then do an install BUT NOT FORMAT THAT SINGLE PARTITION &gt; that I&#x27;m installing on. If I can hack the details, is this theory &gt; accurate, or will RH want to destructively install and elimate all &gt; existing files?You&#x27;re really better off backuping all placed where you know you&#x27;ve hand edited or installed some files. For me that&#x27;s only /etc/, /root/ and /home/. Then you reinstall cleanly, formating &quot;/&quot;, put your /home/ files back into place and you&#x27;re ready to go. That&#x27;s the moment I usually realize I had a nifty tweak to a file in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ or some special parameters added to an /etc/modules.conf entry... so I look at my backup and make the same change again. The only thing where you can get stuck is the grub.conf files, because although there&#x27;s a /etc/grub.conf link, it&#x27;s actually in /boot/grub/ so you may want to copy it too if you have special kernel parameters to save (I have to pass &quot;pci=bios,biosirq&quot; for one of my computers to work for example).HTH, Matthias--  Matthias Saou                                World Trade Center -------------                                Edificio Norte 4 Planta System and Network Engineer                  08039 Barcelona, Spain Electronic Group Interactive                 Phone : +34 936 00 23 23_______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list ",0

"Ananova:Â   Brazilian bees keep their own &#x27;insect ranch&#x27;Scientists have found a new species of bee that behaves like a farmer by keeping herds of insects. The Amazonian Schwarzula use their own &#x27;insect ranches&#x27; to provide food and building materials. The bees nest in holes in trees alongside 200 aphid-like insects from a species called cryptostigma. Cryptostigma feed on tree sap and excrete a sugar solution, which the bees stop them from drowning in, by licking it up and turning it into honey. The insects also produce wax from glands on their backs, which the bees scrape off and use for their nest. Nature reports it is the first time farming behaviour has been discovered in bees. Biologist Joao Camargo, of the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, said: &quot;In turn the bees provide the insects with sanitary benefits and protection.&quot; Writing in the journal Biotropica, Camargo says the bees might even carry their insect ranches around the forest with them and is planning further research on how they tend to their herd. Studies of the Schwarzula showed the bees seemed to get most of their sugar from the insect farms. Some bees were seen licking human sweat for salt.

"&gt; Software vendors have been trying since forever to prevent software piracy. &gt; Remember when you had to enter a specific word from a specific page of the &gt; software manual, which was printed on dark maroon paper so that it could &gt; not be photocopied?  Didn&#x27;t work.  Propritery encoding of DVD&#x27;s?  Didn&#x27;t &gt; work. Software that required the use of a registration key?  Didn&#x27;t work.  &gt; Windows XP was shipped with this supposedly revolutionary method for &gt; stopping piracy, and what happened?  How long was it before the code was &gt; cracked? How many keygens are there for Windows XP?  Is someone running a &gt; pirated version of XP really going to use Windows Update to installed a &gt; service pack which breaks their OS?  Just because M$ didn&#x27;t include the &gt; change in their README?  Fat chance.My problem is not the same as MS&#x27;s one, I don&#x27;t have to deal with millions of  identical copy of the same CD with propably millions of working keys.  Each  download can be unique with a small preparation delay.  The key generator is  a problem only if multiple keys are usable.  If the end users are teenagers,  you&#x27;ll face a huge wall when asking to be 100% of the time online but if we  think of something like a health care system that keep track of patients  personnal information, the end user will be willing to take every possible  steps to protect the system from his own employees to use illegaly.I agree with all of you that mass production CDs will not be safe from piracy  in a near futur.  That can be seen as a collateral of mass market  penetration.BTW thanks for all of you who provided interestiong insight.  I&#x27;m playing with  gdb&#x27;s dissassembler now but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s what a typical cracker would  use.

"Once upon a time, Peter wrote :&gt; I started wondering how does apt react when it finds a newer kernel in &gt; the bunch of &quot;to be updated&quot; files?It skips it. See the /etc/apt/apt.conf file for this.&gt; And has anyone ever tried to do a dist-upgrade, say from 7.1 to 7.2?  &gt; Should it work? If not, why?I&#x27;ve done a dist-upgrade from 7.2 to a quite broken rawhide release... it was a mess, still, it went much faster and smoother than if I had done it &quot;manually&quot; with rpm -U or -F. I think that updates between stable releases should still be done with the installer since IIRC, sometimes a few twitches are done by anaconda to migrate configurations to new formats. It should work though...

Then the first guy said to the fourth guy, &quot;What did you have to promise your wife?&quot;The fourth guy replied, &quot;I didn&#x27;t promise anything.&quot; All the guys were shocked, &quot;How did you do it?!&quot; He replied, &quot;It&#x27;s simple. I set the alarm clock for 5:30. Then I poked my wife and asked, &#x27;Golf course or intercourse?&#x27; And she said, &#x27;Wear your sweater.&#x27;&quot; ",0

"[Anthony Baxter] &gt; I&#x27;ve got a test set here that&#x27;s the last 3 and a bit years email to &gt; info@ekit.com and info@ekno.com - it&#x27;s a really ugly set of 20,000+ &gt; messages, currently broken into 7,000 spam, 9,000 ham, 9,000 currently &gt; unclassified. These addresses are all over the 70-some different &gt; ekit/ekno/ISIConnect websites, so they get a LOT of spam. &gt; &gt; As well as the usual spam, it also has customers complaining about &gt; credit card charges, it has people interested in the service and &gt; asking questions about long distance rates, &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c. Lots and lots &gt; of &quot;commercial&quot; speech, in other words. Stuff that SA gets pretty &gt; badly wrong.Can this corpus be shared?  I suppose not.&gt; I&#x27;m currently mangling it by feeding all parts (text, html, whatever &gt; else :) into the filters, as well as both a selected number of headers &gt; (to, from, content-type, x-mailer), and also a list of (header, &gt; count_of_header). This is showing up some nice stuff - e.g. the &gt; X-uidl that stoopid spammers blindly copy into their messages.If we ever  have a shared corpus, an easy refactoring of timtest should allow to plug in different tokenizers.  I&#x27;ve only made three changes to Graham&#x27;s algorithm so far (well, I&#x27;ve made dozens -- only three survived testing as proven winners), all the rest has been refining the tokenization to provide better clues.&gt; I did have Received in there, but it&#x27;s out for the moment, as it causes &gt; rates to drop.That&#x27;s ambiguous.  Accuracy rates or error rates, ham or spam rates?&gt; I&#x27;m also stripping out HTML tags, except for href=&quot;&quot; and src=&quot;&quot; - there&#x27;s &gt; so so much goodness in them (note that I&#x27;m only keeping the contents of &gt; the attributes).Mining embedded http/https/ftp thingies cut the false negative rate in half in my tests (not keying off href, just scanning for anything that &quot;looked like&quot; one); that was the single biggest f-n improvement I&#x27;ve seen.  It didn&#x27;t change the false positive rate.  So you know whether src added additional power, or did you do both at once?",0
